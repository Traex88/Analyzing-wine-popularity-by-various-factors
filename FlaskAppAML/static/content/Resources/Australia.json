Similar notes of ripe pineapple and nuts mark the palate, then ease to a rather soft, easy finish. Drink now.","84":"Pale copper in hue, this wine exudes passion fruit on the nose, while the palate delivers nuances of muskmelon as well. It's crisp, racy and medium in body, perfectly suited to summertime refreshment. Drink now.","125":"The blend is roughly two-thirds Shiraz and one-third Cabernet, and the result combines berries with cassis and generosity with structure, all framed by toasty oak. Savory in character, long and dusty on the finish. Drink now-2018.","197":"From the little-known region of Padthaway, this Cabernet starts off with some very promising, perfumed aromas of mint and cassis, but then shows touches of chocolate and raisined fruit on the palate. It's soft and mouthfilling\u2014an easy-drinking Cab to consume on the young side.","244":"The sort of wine one imagines early Australian settlers gulped down\u2014big and burly in the mouth and a bit warm, rough and dusty on the finish. Hints of mint-accented cherry fruit and earthy notes.","299":"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates. With a finish that calls to mind chocolate fudge (minus the sugar), opt for drinking this wine over the relatively near term, now to 2020.","349":"This wine contains some material over 100 years old, but shows no signs of fragility. Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely. It's dark coffee-brown in color, with delectable aromas of rancio, dried fig, molasses and black tea, yet despite enormous concentration avoids excessive weight. And it's amazingly complex and fresh on the nearly endless finish.","350":"This deep brown wine smells like a damp, mossy cave. Then add complex rancio notes, plus maple syrup and molasses. It's full, round and harmonious, wonderfully rich yet without any sense of heaviness and long and bright on the finish.","352":"Deep mahogany. Dried fig and black tea on the nose, then concentrated mocha and molasses flavors, enlivened by candied orange zest. Full, rich and sweet, but surprisingly drinkable, with terrific intensity and length.","353":"RunRig is always complex, and the 2012 doesn't disappoint in that regard, mixing bacony-meaty notes with hints of black olives and ripe plums. The tannins are supremely supple, but the acids are crisp, resulting in a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now\u20132030.","360":"Dusty, firm, powerful: just a few apt descriptors for this vintage of one of Heathcote's top wines. Mocha, licorice and blackberries feature on the nose, while the palate delivers more of the same\u2014dark fruit, chocolate and plenty of spice. Best after 2020.","364":"Bacon and tapenade elements merge easily on the nose, followed by a wine that's full bodied and creamy textured on the palate. This is dark and meaty in profile, yet not heavy or cooked, with a long, harmonious finish. Drink now\u20132030.","369":"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky\u2014full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut\u2014but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now\u20132025.","635":"This plush, full-bodied wine is already delicious, delivering wave after wave of savory fruit flavor, something like soy-marinated, char-grilled beef. Tannins are supple enough to make this wine drinkable now, yet plentiful enough to suggest ample cellaring potential. Drink now-2030.","644":"The Torbreck wines, with the emphasis they place on ripeness, can sometimes be controversial. This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon. Mocha joins the party on the long finish. Drink now\u20132025.","757":"Melon and citrus aromas and flavors mingle easily in this cleanly made quaffer. It's a bit plump on the palate, yet refreshing on the lemon-lime finish.","818":"Without any new oak or lees stirring, this wine's sole focus is on the fruit. Pineapple, melon and peach notes are pure and striking, supported by just hints of vanilla and cream. This medium-bodied Chardonnay finishes in a flurry of tangerine and lime.","824":"Built for early consumption, this blend of 59% Grenache, 22% Shiraz and 19% Mataro is lush and warm, offering chocolaty notes alongside hints of brown sugar, grilled meat and blueberries. Drink now\u20132022.","877":"This is ripe, rich and even a touch tannic\u2014almost more of a light red than a true ros\u00e9. This makes it ideally suited to serve alongside summer's various grilled meats. Raspberry and cola flavors finish spicy and round.","905":"This is an unusually complex Shiraz for the price, ably marrying meaty-savory notes with tart berries and plenty of weight on the palate. Crisp structure, finishes long, with lingering acids. Drink now\u20132018.","1010":"Blended from a patchwork of old vineyards throughout the Barossa, this is typical Barossa Shiraz, with plenty of weight and creamy tannins that support plummy, chocolaty fruit. There's a bit of spice for complexity and a crisp, fresh finish. Drink now\u20132014.","1088":"Sourced from vines planted in 1847, this is a full-bodied, open-knit wine, supple and velvety in texture. Vanilla cream and black cherries mark the nose, while the flavors are more savory, resembling black olives and grilled meat. It's long and lush on the finish. Drink it now through 2025.","1170":"This wine boasts admirable complexity, but comes across as a bit angular, with the acids maybe a touch too prominent. Still, the flavors of mint, pepper and meat layered over plum and raspberry fruit offer a lot to like, and the acids may actually make this wine more versatile with food than many more unctuous Shiraz.","1197":"Beyond a hint of stuck flint on the nose, this offers clean, varietally correct aromas and flavors of white nectarine, grapefruit and gooseberry. It's nicely balanced in the middle of the spectrum, offering a harmonious mix of stone fruit and citrus.","1213":"At less than 13% abv, this is on the lighter side of the Rh\u00f4ne white spectrum, offering simple pear and toasted marshmallow aromas and flavors that finish lean and crisp.","1214":"This is plump and custardy in feel, but still refreshing thanks to bright apple and lime aromas and flavors. It's more citrus than apple on the crisp finish.","1495":"This 60-40 blend features gentle aromas of vanilla and cassis in a medium-bodied, creamy-smooth format. It's not powerful or complex, but offers pure cassis and vanilla flavors tinged with chocolate on the finish. Good value.","1664":"This shows some pungent, boxwood-like scents up front, followed by modest passion fruit and a bit of citrus, falling away on the finish. Drink now.","1719":"This medium-bodied Chardonnay features ample apple, pear and pineapple fruit that comes across as pleasant and mouthfilling, if also a bit one-dimensional. Still, it represents a reasonable value.","1736":"Tart blackberry and vanilla flavors mark this bold Shiraz that shows its 14.5% alcohol. There's a rubbery note on the nose that's a bit distracting but should be taken care of by a quick decanting, while black olive and coffee notes emerge on the slightly warm finish.","1903":"Big, bold and structured, this is a dry yet mouthwatering beast of a Shiraz, its blackberry, mocha and black olive notes held in check by firm tannins. Give it 3\u20134 years in the cellar, then drink it over the next several years.","1907":"A product of a hot, short growing season, Lake Folly's 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon shows some slightly overripe notes of cola and prune, but also features a high degree of richness allied to a broad, mouthfilling texture. It lacks nuance, but it is a big, flavorful mouthful that ends with hints of coffee and chocolate. Drink now\u20132010.","1908":"Softer and more approachable than the winery's powerful 2005, this wine offers lush plum, leather and loam notes, accented by a touch of cracked pepper. It's full-bodied and creamy-textured, with a soft finish that invites another sip. Drink now\u20132012.","1911":"Sourced largely from the northern end of the region, this features bold blackberry flavors slightly reminiscent of preserves and marked by dark shadings of cola and chocolate. Yet despite the superripe flavors, the wine remains well structured and retains some slightly herbal overtones. Drink now\u20132012.","1948":"This is a soft, appealing Chardonnay layered with toasted marshmallow and superripe peach. It's round in the mouth and lushly textured, then turns citrusy\u2014almost metallic\u2014on the finish.","1951":"Mint marks the nose of this otherwise darkly attractive wine. Notes of mocha and plum nicely set up the wine, as do the supple tannins, but then there's a jarring edge of prickly acidity that cuts across the palate and disrupts the flow. There are some nice parts here that don't quite come together.","2156":"Brassy in color and woody in aroma, this Chardonnay is a pleasant enough drink, offering ample weight and modest pear and citrus flavors. Drink it through 2017.","2542":"A perplexing wine to evaluate, the 2010 RunRig (97% Shiraz and 3% Viognier) evolves rapidly once poured, going from slightly stewed and overoaked to a wine that shows considerable class within 20 minutes or so. Aromas and flavors of brown sugar, mocha and roasted meat give way to raspberry compote, while the creamy texture and supple tannins conceal the wine's high alcohol level with ease.","2611":"The most aromatically complex of the FE 2012 Rieslings, the Poison Hill offers beguiling scents of tangerine sherbet and Earl Grey tea. It's almost too perfumy for its soft, medium-bodied structure and slightly dusty-textured finish, but those floral elements are also its appeal. Drink now\u20132020+.","2618":"Made in a superripe, dense, almost fudge-like style, The Ripper tastes like a plummy, chocolaty Christmas cake with slightly coarse tannins on the finish. It's Port-like in flavor, but without the heat from elevated alcohol. Drink it over the next few years.","2622":"An easy-drinking introduction to Shiraz from Western Australia's Great Southern region, the 2010 Omrah offers gentle cherry and cedar notes accented by hints of chocolate and roasted meat. It's medium to full bodied, with a round, supple mouthfeel that ends in a wash of softly dusty tannins.","2624":"There's a lot to like in this effort: ample dark fruit, complex notions of tea leaves and dried grasses, and a richly textured, long finish. The wine is medium bodied and not very tannic, making it easy to sip repeatedly. Drink it over the next 8\u201310 years.","2635":"This is a solid value in the world of Cabernet. Textbook notes of cassis and mint lead the way, framed by supple tannins and dressed up with hints of graham crackers and black tea. This is medium to full in weight, with a mouthwatering, velvety finish that belies its price point. Drink now\u20132020+.","2650":"A drink-now style of warming Shiraz, with plenty of weight and richness, soft tannins and flavors that artfully combine sour plum, cracked pepper, rare beef and chocolate. Drink it over the next few years.","2659":"This pale salmon ros\u00e9 is a reliable sparkling wine at a very good price. The latest NV release is toasty on the nose, then offers just faint hints of peach or berry flavors. It's lithe yet creamy on the palate, with a long finish.","2661":"Each Jacob's Creek Reserve wine is now sourced from a specific region, and this Chardonnay shows solid improvement as a result. It's medium in body, with notes of grilled pineapple and sweet corn and a brisk, citrusy finish. Drink it over the next 6\u20139 months.","2979":"There's a tobacco and tomato leaf character that gives this an almost floral aroma, but also simpler cassis and cherry fruit. Some herbal notes persist on the palate, but this medium-bodied wine avoids the vegetal side of things, finishing fresh and clean.","3005":"You've got to like oak to appreciate this wine, which is presently dominated by scents of vanilla, mocha and toasted coconut. It's full bodied and velvety in texture, with hints of black cherry lurking in the background.","3006":"Mouthfilling and round, this wine's savory notes of roasted meat, mocha and cracked pepper frame plummy fruit. Vanilla creeps in on the long, supple finish. Drink now through 2025.","3017":"A solid value, the 2013 Pillar Box offers oodles of blackberry and plum fruit, framed by vanilla and accented by mocha. It's creamy-velvety in texture, with a rich long finish. Drink now through 2025.","3103":"Full bodied and concentrated without being overly heavy or tannic, this is a stunning blend of Shiraz (92%) and Viognier (8%). Hints of roasted or grilled meat and black olive balance the bold blackberry fruit, leaving behind a lingering finish of warmth and dusty cocoa. Drink now\u20132020.","3115":"A lively, balanced wine at an accessible price point, Marquee's 2008 Signature Chard boasts aromas of smoke, vanilla and stone fruit and flavors that follow along similar lines, with white peach and pineapple coming to the fore. Drink now\u20132012.","3122":"From a cooler region than its Bin 28 stablemate, Penfolds' 2007 Bin 128 is a medium-bodied Shiraz that features touches of peppery spice, raspberry-cherry fruit and a darker edge of chocolate and coffee. The tannins are supple without being soft, giving this a drinking window that should extend through 2017 or so.","3299":"This blend is mainly Shiraz (50%) and Grenache (28%), which accounts for the wine's ample, plummy fruit flavors. Accents of grilled meat and slightly briary overtones add complexity, and the wine finishes dry and savory. Drink now-2012.","3310":"Smoky, cedary notes nicely complement the blueberry fruit in this McLaren Vale Shiraz. It's pretty full on the palate, with a slightly syrupy texture that extends the flavors through a mouthwatering finish. Drink now-2012.","3388":"Lean, tight and austere, this textbook Eden Valley Riesling should develop well over the next 5\u20138 years, reaching maturity around 2022. Scents of petrichor and tangerine ease into tart lemon-lime notes on the palate, ending tart and mouthpuckering.","3476":"An innovative blend of Sauvignon Blanc (53%), Semillon (37%) and Viognier (10%), this medium-bodied wine delivers a mix of figs and melons, underscored by a silky texture. Ready to drink.","3484":"Pretty aromas of cherry and plum blossoms give way to fully ripe, slightly confectionary fruit, backed by hints of mocha. This medium-bodied Pinot Noir is supple in texture and softly dusty on the finish, making it an easy one to drink over the next couple of years.","3559":"D'Arenberg's The Coppermine Road is always structured\u2014sometimes to excess\u2014but the 2009 vintage seems to have the requisite flesh to age successfully. Cedar, chocolate and cassis notes surround a firm core of dusty tannins. Drink from 2015\u20132025, and possibly beyond.","3572":"An austere Riesling in the traditional Australian style, the 2012 Isolation Ridge Riesling appears destined to have a long life. Penetrating lime aromas lead into a palate that's high strung and tight, but lined with mouthwatering fruit. An electric vibrancy of citrus and wet stones lingers on the finish. Drink now\u20132030.","3579":"This luxury cuv\u00e9e from Thorne Clarke combines ripe berries with cinnamon and clove, then adds dollops of vanilla and chocolate, yet never seems overly sweet. Likewise, it's full bodied and rich, yet never goes over the top, maintaining a sense of freshness and structure. Drink now\u20132020, and possibly beyond.","3620":"Pale straw with a touch of green to its hue, this is a soft, easygoing Moscato redolent of oranges and pineapples. Finishes fresh and clean despite considerable sweetness.","3621":"A pleasant, sweet little sipper, with more richness than many Australian Moscatos, balanced through a slight touch of bitterness on the finish. Orange and spice notes are joined by just a faint hint of berry fruit.","3624":"Really dark, vibrant purple in color, with oak-inflected notes of cedar, vanilla and chocolate layered over black cherries. It's on the soft, slightly sweet side, but offers an easy-to-drink mouthful of sparkling Shiraz.","3974":"Earthy and tealike, with those attributes framed by charred, nutty oak. It's supple enough to be balanced for immediate consumption.","3976":"Yellow Tail's sparkler is an aromatic blend of Semillon, Traminer, Viognier and Trebbiano that manages to be largely neutral on the palate at the same time it's perfumed on the nose. Frothy and off dry.","3979":"Herbal and green peppercornish, with dark berry flavors and herbal-vegetal notes. Light and crisp; complex for the price.","4125":"Spicy and floral on the nose, this is surprisingly round and soft for an Australian Riesling, but still attractive. Try it young as an ap\u00e9ritif, where the gentleness will subtly prime your palate for things to come.","4163":"Peppers and cloves accent cherry-berry fruit on the nose of this single-vineyard wine. On the palate, it's full bodied and deep and silky in texture, with a long spice-inflected finish.","4360":"Usually one of Yarra's top Pinots, the 2006 YS Reserve is a medium-bodied, rounded wine with extremely soft tannic structure. The aromas hint at brown sugar, coffee and cola, with flavors of roasted root vegetables and a touch of mushroom. Supple and silky on the finish. Drink now.","5118":"This starts off with promisingly vibrant aromas of passion fruit and pink grapefruit, but seems a bit weighty and thickly textured in the mouth. The fruit remains the bold centerpiece, while the finish shows some alcoholic warmth.","5187":"The 2007 Hickinbotham features attractive scents of ground spices, leather and red cherries, but doesn't seem to have the richness and depth of CH's other Grenaches this year. Tart cherry-berry fruit fades into finely textured tannins on the finish. Drink now\u20132015.","5188":"Hints at cedar, spice and dark fruit on the nose, then turns unexpectedly tart on the palate. The tannins are soft, leaving the acidity to provide a counterbalance to the ripe fruit. Drink now.","5327":"Katnook's top Cabernet is always oaky, and the 2006 is no exception, featuring plenty of brown sugar and caramel aromas. Vanilla and cedar dominate the palate, forming an attractive wooden shell over cassis fruit. Drink it now if you like that sort of full-on youthful oak, or hold it a decade until it develops a soft, rich patina of age.","5339":"This takes a page from California in its naming convention and style, which includes a good proportion of barrel-fermentation and oak maturation. Toast and vanilla frame melon and fig notes, and the midpalate is slightly creamy in texture before the wine turns crisp and lemony on the finish. Drink now.","5660":"Henschke is best known for its red wines, but the 2005 Louis S\u00e9millon shows they know a thing or two about whites as well. It combines some toasty, smoky characters with herbal notes on the nose, then develops flavors of wax, spice and citrus, lingering elegantly on the finish. Tasty now, but might develop even more interesting complexities with additional age.","6018":"Broad and ripe, this wine offers hints of lemon curd, crushed stone and cashew butter. Ripe melon fruit flavors dominate the palate, even suggesting honey at times, while anise notes provide a bit of lift on the finish. Drink now.","6404":"Named for one of Barossa's top vineyards, this blends fruit from Barossa, McLaren Vale, Clare Valley and Langhorne Creek into a splendid warm-climate Shiraz. It's full bodied, dense and dusty in texture, with rich dark-fruit flavors of dates, blackberries and blueberries. Hints of baking spices and mocha from the barrel-aging should integrate nicely over the next several years. Drink 2017\u20132025.","6418":"This is another top-flight example of how good the 2012 vintage was for South Australian Shiraz. The oak here is so subtle as to not factor into the wine's scents of raspberry and cracked pepper. Hints of spice and vanilla mark the palate, gently accenting red berry fruit before ending in a flood of silky tannins. Drink now\u20132030.","6693":"Lush and mouthfilling, this tropical-fruited Chard offers a ton of flavors at a surprisingly small price. Smoky toasted-almond notes accent star fruit and guava flavors. Drink now\u20132011.","6988":"Petrol and citrus aromas and flavors merge seamlessly in this medium-bodied dry Riesling. It seems atypically round for such a young Eden Valley Riesling, so maybe not a long-term proposition, but it goes down easily now, with a long, slightly oily finish.","6991":"Not quite as impressive as some other vintages, the 2002 Print Shiraz boasts plenty of color but lacks some nuance and freshness. Aromas of baking spices are tinged with coffee, anise and dates, while the flavors of dried fruit and chocolate dominate the palate. It's big and mouthfilling, with 15% alcohol.","7120":"There's 10% Zinfandel blended into this wine, but looking at my notes, I never would've thought so. The pale color is all Pinot Noir, as are the aromas of earth and tomato (the vanilla comes from the French oak barrels). It's light and crisp, with a tart finish.","7129":"De Bortoli's 2006 Estate Grown Pinot Noir lacks the bright fruit and user-friendliness of its Gulf Station or Windy Peak bottlings. Maybe it's too serious for its own good? This medium-bodied wine features leather, mushroom and molasses, and rather crisp acids as well.","7130":"Aromas of sour cherry and cooked strawberries lead the way in this tart, herbal Pinot Noir. It's lean and crisp, failing to deliver much in the way of pleasure, although there's nothing technically wrong with it.","7349":"The blend is 55% Grenache, 25% Shiraz and 20% Mourv\u00e8dre, but while this is a full-bodied wine, it's not overdone or bombastic. The masses of dark fruit are reined in by crisp acids and a layer of supple tannins, adding depth to the cassis, vanilla and mint flavors. Drink now through 2020.","7439":"The 2008 Brookman Syrah is a rich, plush, luxurious wine. Aromas of cedar, vanilla and black cherry set the stage, while the palate features intense dark fruit layered with hints of olive and coffee. It's full bodied and creamy in texture, showing just a touch of warmth on the supple finish. Drink now\u20132020.","7536":"Kalbarri's Cab boasts plenty of red-berry flavors and a soft, easygoing, maybe even slightly sweet, finish.","7569":"Phil Sexton's wines under the Giant Steps label are becoming more consistent, and the 2014s may be his best yet. This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, with a supple, creamy texture and lingering notes of spring flowers and black cherries. Subtle oaking adds brown sugar and mocha shadings to the crisp finish. Drink now\u20132022.","7709":"Yes, a certain amount of acidity is desirable in Australian Riesling, but this one is exceedingly lean and crisp. Perhaps it will blossom with age, but for now it is simply intensely citrusy and rather skinny. Pair it with oysters, or put it in a cool dark place and hope for the best.","7761":"This medium-bodied Chardonnay boasts a fair degree of complexity for its modest tariff: slightly toasty, nutty aromas lead into flavors of hazelnut, ripe peach and citrus. A solid effort.","7790":"The 2015 Estate Chardonnay is a fruit-foward wine, offering bright pineapple and citrus flavors that reverberate on the refreshing finish. On the whole, it is straightforward, with an approachable texture.","7836":"This wine starts off a bit tarry at first, with scents of asphalt and roasted meat that then give way to brighter notes of blackberry and vanilla. On the palate, it's full, supple and rich, with a finish marked by hints of campfire and cherry.","7851":"This bottling is consistently among the best Margaret River Chardonnays, and the 2013 doesn't disappoint. Subtle notes of grilled peach and pineapple slices are carried by ample weight and richness on the midpalate, then gain focus and fold in citrus flavors on the long finish.","7868":"There aren't many white wines coming out of Langhorne Creek, but this Verdelho is a good one, offering crisp, citrusy notes of pear and pineapple, medium body and a clean, refreshing finish. Drink now.","7881":"It seems as if the emphasis is more on the oak than on the fruit. But the oak is darn tasty\u2014toasty, vanillin and bringing all sorts of dried-spice complexities to the table. The wine is creamy and full enough to support the oak, even if the cherry-berry flavors do take a back seat. \u2014J.C.","7888":"This kitchen-sink blend boasts a high percentage of Petit Verdot (38%), which may account for its dramatic floral aromatics. Aside from roses, cherries also play a role. In the mouth, complex floral-herbal elements have a solid underpinning of cherries and raspberries, finishing with just enough tannins to stand up to rare beef. \u2014J.C.","7899":"A soft, round wine that almost seems designed for glugging. Dusty earth and dried grass aromas give way to a sweet, alcoholic attack filled with red berries and cherries. The warm, spirity finish leaves you glowing and reaching for another sip. \u2014J.C.","7966":"Representative of the solid values that may be found from Australia for about $20, this medium- to full-bodied Shiraz offers a blend of cherry and plum flavors, with savory elements of mocha and roasted meat. It's slightly dusty on the finish, making it food-friendly, ending with hints of cocoa and coffee. Drink now\u20132018.","7968":"The Angove family is crafting some increasingly interesting wines in recent years. This blend of 55% Grenache, 25% Shiraz and 20% Mourv\u00e8dre features intriguing notes of cola, brown sugar and cinnamon layered over a plush base of ripe black cherries. It's mouthfilling and round, with a soft, licorice-tinged finish. Drink now\u20132018.","7983":"Despite a reported alcohol level that's moderate for its genre, this feels nicely full and rounded on the palate. Hints of vanilla and sarsaparilla accent flavors of cherries, plums and chocolate, while the tannins are supple and creamy in texture. Drink now\u20132018.","7992":"This inexpensive Shiraz (60%) and Cab (40%) blend represents a solid value, blending cassis and dark coffee flavors with hints of mint and bell pepper. The green notes are adequately balanced by ripe fruit, and the tannins are extremely supple, finshing on a velvety note.","8002":"Features some superb elements that come off as a bit disjointed\u2014perhaps it just needs some time? High-toned cherry fruit picks up some herbal notes and peppery cinnamon flavors, then finishes crisp, with hints of orange pekoe tea.","8222":"Medium to full in weight and opulent in texture, this is a buttery creamy wine that reflects its South Australian origin. Broad and rich, it's a throwback to a previous generation's style of Chardonnay.","8226":"Slightly smoky grilled-toast aromas lead into a plump medium-bodied wine filled with flavors of yellow plum, tangerine and lime. It's not particularly zesty or linear in a true cool-climate fashion, but steers clear of ripe tropical fruit, ending on a gentle note of citrus pith. Drink now.","8638":"This doesn't have the sheer breadth of many Australian Viogniers, but it offers more structure and length on the palate. Vibrant lemon-lime and pineapple aromas set the stage for flavors of tropical fruit and lemon custard. There's a slightly creamy texture and a lingering finish. Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.","8641":"Nearly a Best Buy, this Riesling offers early drinkability relative to many of its Clare cousins. Mixed citrus and crushed-stone aromas mark the nose, while the medium-bodied palate finishes long, with what seems to be a touch of sweetness. Drink now\u20132010.","8649":"From a reliable Clare Valley producer, Pikes 2006 Dry Riesling appears to be an ageworthy effort, boasting plenty of crisp intensity. Lime, grapefruit and green apple notes are classic Riesling markers, ending long and mouthwatering. Drink now\u20132016, possibly beyond. Imported by USA Wine West.","8989":"Dark and rich, with aromas of cola and coffee and flavors of plum and cola. This is full-bodied, its 14.5% alcohol balanced by fruit intensity and richly textured tannins and the long finish. Drink 2010\u20132020.","8994":"A dark and hearty McLaren Vale Shiraz, with plenty of weight and tannin and concentrated cola, black olive and leather flavors. Hints of mulberry, cedar and vanilla lighten it just enough, but this wine could use another few years before entering its prime drinking window. Finishes long and richly tannic. Drink 2010\u20132020.","9060":"A solid effort that should have broad commercial appeal, Yangarra's 2006 Grenache displays a squeaky-clean bouquet of black cherries, mixed berries and a touch of vanilla. It's soft and velvety in the mouth, with a full, round presence, mixed fruit flavors and a touch of wood spice. Drink now\u20132010.","9291":"This wine nicely displays the fleshy pear, melon and citrus notes of unoaked Chard. It's plump and medium-bodied, with a clean, refreshing finish. What it isn't is particularly complex, but it will still go well with any number of seafood or chicken dishes this summer.","9294":"The d'Arenberg style favors structure over plushness, even in Grenache. This is crisp and firm, its cranberryish fruit tinged with hints of raspberry, orange zest, cinnamon and clove. Give it a few years to soften. Drink 2020\u20132030.","9309":"This doesn't appear to be the strongest recent vintage of this wine, but it remains a benchmark for McLaren Vale Shiraz. Hints of vanilla and tobacco leaf add nuance to a mix of berries ranging from red raspberry to black currant, but there's also a hint of bruised fruit and a green toughness to the tannins. Give it some time in the cellar. Drink 2020\u20132030.","9425":"Marked by simple pineapple and citrus flavors, this plump, fleshy-textured Chard turns unexpectedly crisp and slighly metallic on the finish.","9432":"Shows some rather lactic overtones to go with ample citrus and guava flavors. Medium-bodied, with a fresh, lemony finish.","9584":"Tasted at their regular release date less than a year after the vintage, the Tahbilk Marsannes aren't terribly expressive. The key is bottle age, and this Museum Release has it. Lemon custard and thyme are tinged with hints of toast and marmalade in this medium-bodied white. A touch of creaminess on the midpalate extends through a long finish.","9746":"This has all the touchstones of good Chardonnay: just enough body and richness, apple, pineapple and melon fruit flavors and a crisp, citrusy finish. Solid Chardonnay for under $10.","9869":"It will be interesting to see if the release of this luxury-level Shiraz (the second vintage) has any impact on the perception of Casella's other brands: Yellow Tail and Peter Lehmann. Even at nine years of age, this is impressively dark and intense, with minty notes, cedar and vanilla and meaty, umami-like flavors that linger on the long, silky finish. Drink now.","9889":"Cassis and chocolate notes dominate, but there's enough minty, eucalypt character to impart complexity, all framed by some firm, dusty tannins. Finishes long and mouthwatering; drink now\u20132015. Multiple U.S. importers.","9991":"From a top subsection of McLaren Vale, this well-crafted Shiraz features a nice balance of sweet and savory notes. Ripe blackberry and plum flavors are matched by nuances of cedar, spice and meat. This creamy-textured Shiraz seems to be already approaching maturity; drink it now through 2012.","10055":"Perhaps this just needs some additional time for the Cabernet and Shiraz components to meld, because right now it comes across as slightly chunky and warm, with cassis and plum flavors verging on prune, yet nicely framed by vanilla and cedar. Try 2012\u20132020, although this wine has a track record that suggests longer aging isn't out of the question.","10160":"There's a bright, almost Ribena-like quality to the fruit in this wine, with underlying hints of wood and mint. It's full bodied, but the tannins are modest and softly rounded, making it deceptively easy to down. Drink now\u20132018.","10613":"This is a lean, austere\u2014even a bit severe\u2014Riesling that looks to need a good five years or more to mellow. Crushed stone and citrus pith finish long and painfully tart.","10893":"Gemtree's Obsidian Shiraz ratchets up the intensity from its usual offerings, adding structure and richness to straight-ahead aromas and flavors of cherries, coffee and vanilla. The wood sticks out a little on the finish, so give it another year or two in the bottle, then drink it over the next 10.","10897":"Matured 18 months in French oak, this rich, velvety-textured Shiraz shows plenty of vanilla influence as a result. But there's also plenty of ripe blackberry fruit, and the overall impression is of a lush, fruity wine that would make a lovely steakhouse red.","10964":"This is a meaty, dark-fruited Shiraz. Seductive notes of caramelized beef and brown sugar dominate, while the wine's texture is a bit coarse, turning astringent on the finish. Try in 2017.","11564":"Made in a somewhat restrained, focused style, this wine features hints of smoke combined with peach and pineapple notes to create the impression of grilled fruit aromas and flavors. It's linear and crisp on the palate, with admirable length and mouthwatering citrus notes on the finish. Ready to drink now.","11565":"Cullen's Kevin John remains one of Margaret River's (and Australia's) benchmark Chardonnays. Scents of grilled peaches lead into flavors of pineapple, vanilla and smoke, but more importantly, the palate is balanced just right. It's not too broad, not too lean; not overly sharp, but not soft. The finish is long and harmonious.","11595":"A bold, aggressive wine that lacks a bit of elegance, the 2008 Galvo Garage is a big mouthful of cassis and cedar. In another few years it may settle down, but for now the overall impression is of a rather rough customer that's best suited to be poured alongside grilled steak.","11620":"The flagship wine from a relatively new Barossa producer, the 2004 Benno features smoky, savory, spice- and meat-driven aromas that easily move into complex and well-integrated flavors of spice and dark berries. Despite its labeled 15% alcohol, the wine isn't heavy, instead offering medium body and a creamy smooth texture. Finishes long, with lingering dark fruit flavors. Drink now\u20132020.","11813":"A blend of two-thirds Shiraz, one-third Grenache, Kilikanoon's entry-level blend is a soft, easygoing combination of blackberries, cola, brown sugar and cinnamon. Drink it over the next year or two.","11825":"The 60% Grenache shows in this wine's red-berry aromas and flavors, while the 20% Mourv\u00e8dre imparts a slightly horsey, leathery note. It's full-bodied and lushly textured, it just doesn't seem quite as harmonious at this stage as some earlier vintages.","11894":"Yalumba has been working hard at this style of ros\u00e9, and the 2012 is very successful. It's medium in weight, with pretty red-fruit aromas and flavors of watermelon and strawberry. An undercurrent of minerality rides through the palate and finishes slightly chalky. Drink up.","11898":"A thread of dusty mushroom underlies some pretty raspberry and cream notes in this full-bodied Shiraz, adding an astringent note to the finish. Drink now\u20132025.","11920":"Features charred and herbal overtones, but otherwise pleasant cherry fruit and a weightiness borne of moderately high alcohol (14%). The fruit fades a bit quickly on the finish, leaving some drying tannins behind, so serve with rare beef or lamb.","11942":"Yalumba has been pushing the organic envelope in recent years, and this Shiraz is a winner. It's full bodied and supple nearly to the point of creaminess, but delivers mixed berry, vanilla and baking-spice flavors, all with a certain amount of elegance. Drink now\u20132022.","11959":"Tasted blind, this wasn't particularly different from the other Rieslings in its flight, which were predominantly South Australian. It's got those same wet stone and citrus tendencies and is made in the same medium-bodied, dry, high-acid style. There's a touch of pineapple as well, plus a long, dry crisp finish.","12113":"This wine's plum, mocha and cedar notes are carried by ample body and a silky texture. It's a round, supple blend of 59% Shiraz, 31% Grenache and 10% Mourv\u00e8dre that finishes long, reverberating with fresh acids and mocha shadings. Drink it over the next several years.","12814":"Faintly nutty notes of toasted grain accent this wine's otherwise straightforward pineapple fruit. It's medium in body, with a fine line of crisp acidity running through it from start to finish. Drink now.","12906":"Really nicely done, with bold cassis aromas tinged with hints of tomato leaf and vanilla and then waves of cassis, vanilla and dried spices on the palate. It's full bodied and lushly textured, with a long, velvety feel to the finish. Best from 2010\u20132020.","12908":"This intriguing stickie is predominantly (94%) Chardonnay\u2014an unusual choice for a botrytized wine. Dried apricot and ripe pear aromas lead the way, with the flavors leaning toward intensely honeyed apricot preserves. It's full-bodied, lush and candy-sweet, with a mouthcoating finish.","12930":"A blend of 64% Merlot and 36% Cabernet Sauvignon, the resulting wine is complex, round and complete. Aromas and flavors of plum, leather, cured meat and spice are carried by plenty of weight, yet without seeming heavy. There's a lush, slightly creamy mouthfeel and a long, spicy finish. Delicious now, but should hold at least through 2015.","13315":"A solidly built, rather chunky Cabernet, the 2009 Pillar Box Reserve delivers plummy fruit framed by vanilla and tobacco notes. The tannins are a bit coarsely textured on the finish, but leave behind an appetizingly mouthwatering sensation. Drink now\u20132020.","13456":"Bursting with bold, fully ripe fruit notes of pear and peach, followed up with tropical notes, this is a lush fruit bomb of a Chardonnay to drink over the near term (3\u20134 months).","13510":"An excellent value, Hardys' Oomoo Shiraz can run with a pack twice its price, offering earth and cola aromas and a deep undercurrent of blackberries. It's full-bodied, mouthfilling yet structured. Adds flavors of black olives to the mix, along with velvety tannins and mouthwatering acids on the finish.","13582":"This partnership continues to turn out marvelously complex wines from inland Victoria. Savory, herbal and intriguing on the nose, with hints of raspberry, mushroom and smoked meat, this is a medium-bodied, supple wine. Dusty tannins impart a silky quality to the finish. Drink now\u20132018.","13610":"A lean, toasty style that pairs dried spices\u2014cinnamon and ginger\u2014with zesty citrus fruits. The toast and vanilla battle green and lime flavors from the nose all the way through the finish.","13619":"Fits the big-production Aussie recipe to a T, blending tropical fruit, vanilla, apple and citrus flavors. It's just a little lighter than expected and finishes short.","13715":"Made mistelle fashion, with fortification taking place prior to fermentation to help preserve the variety's citrus and tea-leaf aromas and flavors. Honeyed orange and lemon flavors take on a leafy edge, showing a hint of bitterness on the finish.","13812":"This is barely sparkling, which gives it a rather weighty feel. Slightly oily aromas and indistinct white fruit flavors finish on the dry side. It's an interesting blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Verdelho.","13822":"A disappointing release, with tired white-fruit aromas and slightly confected, rubbery flavors. It's a traditional sparkling blend of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier.","13980":"Cropped at less than two tons per acre, this is a full-bodied, creamy-textured Tempranillo marked by vanilla-tinged oak. Black cherries and plums comprise the core, with embellishments of tobacco adding complexity to this lush, easy-drinking wine. Drink it over the next several years.","13993":"Yalumba's flagship Viognier is a broad, powerful wine, with pineapple and apricot flavors marked by hints of floral perfume and spice. Not quite as aromatically expressive as the Eden Valley bottling, it may be a touch denser and more concentrated, with potential to evolve through 2014 or so.","14376":"Dry Riesling of this quality is capable of aging up to two decades, especially under screw cap. this one is medium bodied and dominated at the moment by ripe, citrusy fruit. It's more orange than lime, yet still shows great acidity and length. Drink 2020\u20132030.","14405":"This wine's concentrated dark fruit shows in the color\u2014a vibrant dark garnet\u2014and in the aromas of blueberry, vanilla and dried spices. The 16% alcohol is well concealed, manifesting only as wonderfully full, creamy density on the palate, magnifying the intense cola, earth and spice complexity. A pronounced peppery, black licorice note adds extra length to the finely textured finish. Drink now\u20132020.","14707":"Shows some rather riper-than-expected fruit flavors, hinting at peach or nectarine as well as the standard apple and lime. The result seems a touch off-dry, although the actual residual sugar is only 3.5 g\/L. Despite being lightweight in the mouth, it turns a bit honeyed and weightier on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.","14732":"This Grenache-based blend derives considerable structure from its Shiraz (38%) and Mourv\u00e8dre (7%) components, giving it more firmness, length and ageability than might be expected. Dark chocolate and berry aromas and flavors pick up hints of dried tobacco and other herbs, ending on a crisp note. Give it two or three years, then drink it over the next 10\u201312.","14766":"It's nice to see high-quality dry Riesling at such a reasonable price. This does show some riper, peachier aromas and flavors than truly classic Eden Valley Riesling, but it remains true to the regional style, just more approachable. Drink now.","14967":"Dark hints of charred oak and cola accent bright berry aromas, while the palate is marked by bold berry and black cherry flavors and a whack of vanilla. It's a medium-bodied red that comes across as a bit hard-edged because of its acidity despite having rather soft tannins. Drink now.","14986":"Fresh and juicy, this easy-drinking blend provides simple mint and cassis aromas and flavors at a reasonable price, with just enough structure to stand up to burgers and the like. Drink now\u20132013.","15256":"Grenache is being treated with more and more respect around Australia, which means more bottlings are reaching the variety's potential. Gentle herbal notes intertwine with bunches of black cherries and a hint of vanilla in this medium- to full-bodied example. Hints of red peppercorn capture a unique combination of fruit and spice, while the finish is long and crisp.","15261":"It's a shame only the equivalent of one barrel of this wine was exported to the U.S., as it means only a handful of people here will get to experience it. It's perhaps the closest thing to great white Burgundy to come from Australia; subtly smoky at first, like grilled white peaches, adding hints of lime and vanilla on the palate. It's plump and slightly creamy in texture, but finishes with crisp, acidic verve. Drink now\u20132025.","15391":"A lean, streamlined version of Aussie Shiraz, with leathery notes of dried currants that finish firm and crisp.","15596":"Full bodied, rich and thickly textured, this is just a bit earthier and chunkier than Chambers' Rare bottling, while still remaining an outstanding sweet wine. The flavors are dark, earthy and intense, with lots of candied date notes and a lingering finish of molasses.","15602":"Big and bold, with firm tannins, this powerful Shiraz shows all the ingredients that point to excellent aging potential. Hints of toast and cracked pepper accent dark-berry aromas, while the flavors mix ripe fruit and intriguing spice notes. The finish is marked by espresso, firm tannins and terrific length. Drink 2020\u20132030.","15813":"This crisp, focused wine may not be quite as racy as its namesake dog breed, but it is very fresh. There's a touch of green apple, but the majority of the fruit leans more toward white grapeffruit, with a long finish.","15821":"A blend of 70% Semillon and 30% Sauvignon Blanc, Plantagenet's Hazard Hill white is fresh and grapefruity, with hints of melon to help round it out. Crisp acids and modest weight make it refreshing--it would be fine as an ap\u00e9ritif or with seafood. Drink now.","15869":"Comes across as being on the sweet side of the brut spectrum, but it's still a solid value, offering bold pineapple flavors and just a hint of toast on the finish.","15963":"Full-bodied and richly textured, this more than delivers at its suggested retail price. Grilled plums, baking spices and mocha notes provide plenty of interest, finishing creamy and supple. Drink now\u20132020.","16361":"Full bodied, creamy and lush, this is a prototypical Barossa Valley Shiraz from a longtime master of the variety. Smoke, cedar, mulberry and eucalyptus notes mingle easily on the nose, while savory notes of roasted meat and dried herb blend seamlessly into the fruit, ending long, velvety and rich.","16378":"This wine is fleshy and seductive, with irresistible layers of smoke, mint and plum. It's full bodied, creamy textured and lush, staying supple through the long, charming finish. Drink now through 2025.","16588":"Rich, dense and intense, this is a big, muscular rendering of Barossa Shiraz. Scents of maple syrup and menthol intertwine with flavors of ripe plums and grilled meat. It's mouthcoating and long on the tannic finish, so give it some time in the cellar; drink 2020\u20132030.","16692":"Worth the effort to find, this wine shows terrific balance in every respect. Subtle oak and spice frame ripe cherry fruit on the nose. Refreshing herb and spice elements add zest to cherry and cola flavors on the palate, where the wine is fleshy without being at all heavy. The ripe tannins on the finish are supple enough to make this approachable now, but it should also evolve gracefully for at least five-to-eight years.","16913":"Sold in 1-liter Tetra Prisma packaging meant to reduce greenhouse emissions, this is an ecofriendly wine that tastes good. Its bouquet is its strongest asset, offering floral, perfumy notes of white pepper and rhubarb, while the palate is on the light side for Shiraz, but clean and supple. Drink now.","16922":"A soft, silky-textured Pinot Noir, this wine starts off with admirable complexity on the nose in the form of bacon, smoke, fresh greens and strawberries. Despite an overall lack of punch, it's easy to drink and offers decent value in Pinot Noir. Imported by AUSA Pacific, LLC.","17002":"A terrific value, Dutchke's Willow Bend is a round, generous blend that features complex spice elements alongside lush fruit. Cassis and blackberry notes are tinged with cocoa, cinnamon and licorice.","17105":"For the price, this is pretty decent. It shows ample volume in the mouth and features lightly stewed fruit notes of mixed berries balanced by a touch of wood.","17107":"Hints of camphor and adhesive bandage mingle with raspberry compote on the nose, while the flavors turn a bit stewed, with the camphor gaining in prominence. It's taut and tart, with a lean edge to the finish.","17141":"Phil Sexton's wines under the Giant Steps label are becoming more consistent, and the 2014s may be his best yet. This is a medium- to full-bodied wine, with a supple, creamy texture and lingering notes of spring flowers and black cherries. Subtle oaking adds brown sugar and mocha shadings to the crisp finish. Drink now\u20132022.","17468":"Showing some bricking at the rim, at nearly seven years of age this is a mature, herbal Cabernet. Vanilla notes frame tobacco, earthy and slightly vegetal flavors of bell pepper and tomato. Tannins are firm and chewy, while the fruit seems to be receding. Drink up.","17595":"This should have fairly widespread appeal for its bold cherry fruit aromas and balanced feel. Floral notes add interest on the nose, while the palate shows some savory mushroom and dusty earth character. The tannins are slightly astringent on the finish, so opt for red meat rather than a more delicate dish. Drink now.","17720":"The centerpiece of Phil Sexton's current venture (he previously founded and sold both a brewery and a winery) is this single vineyard, from which he makes a Pinot Noir and this wine. The 2012 Chard is a bold yet elegant wine, filled with grilled pineapple and citrus fruit and framed by hints of toasted nuts, vanilla and graphite.","17805":"Neither McLaren Vale nor Adelaide Hills are particularly known for their Rieslings, but this is a fine example. Scents of wet stone and flower-shop greens lead into off-dry flavors of lemon zest and green apples. The balance between sugar and acids, lithe body and long finish is finely judged. Drink now\u20132025.","17825":"This is Yalumba's flagship Viognier, barrel-fermented for an extra layer of richness. Fig, melon and apricot notes mark the nose and palate, and while it is fully ripe and weighty, it carries its alcohol well. Fruit intensity easily balances the oak, which remains almost invisible.","17826":"While the trend among many Australian Cabernets is towards moderate, silky tannin structures, this austere, firm wine embraces its dry, dusty nature. Cedar and toast frame big cassis fruit, ending with chewy tannins. Drink 2018\u20132028.","17828":"Roughly two-thirds Shiraz and one-third Grenache, this is a full-bodied, lush example of Barossa Valley product. Hints of mint and cracked pepper add nuance to the ripe raspberry fruit, while spice and red-fruit nuances linger on the supple yet spine-tingling finish. Drink now\u20132020 for its youthful exuberance.","17841":"The Cabernet accounts for just 10% of the blend, but presumably contributes the hints of dried marjoram that add interest to the vanilla and cassis aromas and flavors. This medium-bodied wine finishes dry, with softly dusty tannins. Ready to drink now.","17860":"This medium-bodied red is a bit obvious and confected, but delivers ample cassis fruit without any obvious structure to support it. It's jammy and a bit sweet-tasting on the finish.","17977":"Pretty good Merlot, with varietally correct scents of black cherries and mocha leading into flavors of blue and black fruits. It's medium in body, with ample fruit and hints of chocolate and coffee on the finish.","18013":"This is a well-priced example of Barossa Cabernet, laden with characteristic notes of chocolate, mint and berry fruit, wrapped in a layer of toasty oak. It's full bodied, yet easy to drink because of the soft tannins and mouthwatering finish. Probably best between now and 2020.","18014":"At 6+ years post-vintage, this wine seems pretty mature. The tannins are supple, while the fruit is starting to take on some dried character. Other notes include molasses, caramel, dried leaves and tomato. The blend is 88% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Sangiovese.","18485":"Full bodied and richly textured, this is a terrific value in Barossa Cabernet. And it's no simple fruity concoction, either. Instead, it delivers complex notes of grilled meat, coffee and black olive layered easily over a base of dark plums. Finishes long, velvety and mouthwatering; drink now\u20132020.","18686":"Although not nearly as flashy as many of its brethren, this is a well balanced Barossa Shiraz that could cellar well. Hints of mint accent the nose, bolstered by toasty oak, while the flavors feature red currants and raspberries. The acids are reasonably crisp given the context, lingering nicely on the finish. Fine to drink now, but try to save a few bottles until 2020 or so to see how it develops.","18709":"A relative bargain amid top-quality McLaren Vale Shiraz, the 2005 Top of the Hill Shiraz is beginning to show some softening and signs of maturity, yet remains intensely perfumed and flavored. Coffee bean and black olive notes start it off, backed by enough fruit richness to give it an expansive mouthfeel and long finish. Drink now\u20132015.","18717":"Hugh Hamilton's top-of-the-line wine is the Jekyll & Hyde Shiraz-Viognier. In 2007, it's a full-bodied, richly textured wine filled with raspberry, cherry and chocolate aromas and flavors. Based on its somewhat chewy finish, it should last and evolve through at least 2020.","18901":"This is a nice Bordeaux-style blend with pretty cherry and currant fruit and some cedar shadings, but lack the complexity of others in its style. It's straight forward, polite and restrained.","18916":"Subtle aromas of grilled bread, citrus curd and peach set the stage for a plump, medium-bodied wine that boasts restrained flavors of white peach, pineapple and lime. Drink now\u20132016.","19020":"Powerful tea and bergamot notes are fresh and orangey, balancing deeper, richer notes of toffee and honey. Long on the finish, and not overly sweet.","19091":"Showing a bit of evolution, The Turk features hints of leather and beef alongside blackberry and cassis. It's reasonably complex for the price, but dries out a bit on the finish, suggesting it may be past its best. Drink up.","19107":"A solid effort, this basic red blend features mint accents layered over slightly herbal cassis aromas and flavors. It's medium-bodied, with silky tannins on the finish. Drink now.","19113":"Surprisingly full bodied, lush and expansive given its moderate alcohol level, this is a whirlwind of tropical fruit and buttered nuts on the nose. It then grows more refined and understated on the palate, where the flavors are white peach, melon and citrus.","19120":"This is a full-bodied, lushly textured Chardonnay that manages to avoid the sensation of excess weight. Pear, melon and white peach notes are framed by understated toasted nuttiness, while a long line of acid prolongs the harmonious finish. Drink now\u20132018.","19127":"Named for a Margaret River subregion, Cape Mentelle's Wilyabrup is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It's structured and restrained on the palate, easily blending cherry, cedar, leather and earth notes in a truly claret-styled wine whose dry finish picks up hints of black tea. Drink now\u20132020.","19242":"This medium- to full-bodied wine manages to be mouthfilling and round without being excessively soft or syrupy. A savory, meaty, coffee-like note complements the ripe blackberry fruit, which persists a good long time on the finish. Drink now\u20132015.","19248":"Loaded with smoke, hickory and vanilla, this definitely shows plenty of oak, but there's also plenty of fruit to balance the ledger. Cola and blackberry flavors pick up a slightly tart edge on the long, finely textured finish.","19258":"Dry, lean and tight, this is a crisply mineral Sauvignon Blanc that manges to avoid any sense of grassiness or overly herbal notes, instead focusing on a narrow range of fruit flavors: green apple, lime and grapefruit. Fine as an ap\u00e9ritif or with light seafood dishes. Drink now.","19333":"Made in a soft, user-friendly style, the 2008 DB Family Selection Petite Sirah offers up a flavorful mouthful of plum and baking spices. It's medium-bodied, with a silkiness to the structure that belies the grape variety, yet that same softness makes it immediately appealing. Drink now.","19341":"Coming in at just under 13% alcohol, this is a dry, Provence-styled ros\u00e9 marked by crisp strawberry and citrus flavors. Ending on a refreshing, slightly chalky-mineral note, this would make a fun summer sipper.","19429":"Subtle aromas of grilled bread, citrus curd and peach set the stage for a plump, medium-bodied wine that boasts restrained flavors of white peach, pineapple and lime. Drink now\u20132016.","19430":"This is a nice Bordeaux-style blend with pretty cherry and currant fruit and some cedar shadings, but lack the complexity of others in its style. It's straight forward, polite and restrained.","19440":"More concentrated-tasting and intense than some of d'Arenberg's other 2011 single-vineyard Shirazes, this is still somewhat restrained. Some tobacco notes add nuance to the Ribena-like fruit, picking up hints of vanilla and earth on the finish.","19585":"For $20, you could do a lot worse than to sample this wine, which boasts plenty of varietal character and ample quality. Cedar, tobacco, cassis and dark chocolate suggest a fully ripe wine, while the the structure remains fine and linear, with gentle, cocoa-powder-textured tannins that line the finish. Drink now\u20132025.","19601":"This is a dry, relatively austere wine. It showcases aromas of wet stone and lemon thyme, followed by flavors of pineapple and lemon and a long, citrusy finish. Drink now.","19734":"Bright, lean and vibrant, this is a medium-bodied ros\u00e9 with gingery-citrusy notes that could go well with fish or poultry dishes.","19752":"This widely available, bargain-priced tawny remains an Australian classic, offering toffee and walnut aromas and flavors along with dust-covered leather and just a hint of fresh fruit. It's lighter in weight than you might expect from a Port-inspired New World wine, but offers a tasty drop on a wintry evening. Imported by Pacific Wine Partners.","19786":"This sees less new oak than the Jones Block, so the quality of the biodynamically grown fruit shines. Herbal notes reminiscent of rosemary and thyme accent raspberry and cherry fruit, and while there's ample weight and ripeness, the overall impression is of drinkability and ease.","19884":"A blend of Shiraz from Eden Valley and the valley floor, this is both amply endowed and impressively complex. The creamy pur\u00e9e of raspberries is dusted with peppery spice and cocoa, leaving a savory impression on the lasting finish. Drink now\u20142015.","20096":"It's hard to believe such a wine can come from the Barossa, a region known for size and richness. But this is part of a new wave of Aussie Shiraz\u2014medium in body and silky in style, with moderate alcohol levels. Healthy doses of oak impart notes of hickory smoke, cedar and vanilla to the plum fruit. Drink now\u20132025.","20299":"There's a touch of wood to this wine, but the primary emphasis is on citrusy, pineapple-scented fruit. Apple flavors provide roundness, while the wine finishes citrusy and fresh without being sharp.","20959":"Nicely made in a cool-climate style, this medium-bodied Shiraz offers hints of pepper and clove alongside crisp, sour plum fruit. Charming spice shadings line the long, mouthwatering finish.","20965":"Mainly Shiraz (87%), this is a meaty, savory and plummy red at a reasonable price. Hints of vanilla and cola impart additional complexity, while the mouthfeel is creamy, cushioned by ripe tannins. It drops off just a little on the finish, but it's still a very good drop for near-term consumption.","21252":"This is pungent, showing some sweaty, boxwood notes alongside lemony citrus fruit. It's light on its feet, with moderately intense lemon flavors that fade on the finish. Drink now.","21265":"Australia used to make more blends like this, using the acids of Semillon to balance the ripeness of Chardonnay. In this case, they come together to offer toasty, honeyed notes backed by a strong lemony spine. It's crisp and tart on the finish at first, then relaxes rapidly with airing, so drink it over the next year or so.","21284":"This 60-40 blend combines Shiraz's blackberry fruit with Cab's slightly herbal notes to make a pretty marriage. It shows enough firmness to stand up to rich, fatty meats now, or to sustain it through up to a decade of cellaring.","21496":"Octavius has always been oaky, but over the years the fruit has come into better balance, and the 2009 may be one of the most successful editions yet released. It's dense and impenetrable at first, only slowly yielding hints of plum, mocha and vanilla. The texture is rich and supple enough to make the wine approachable now, but it should evolve and improve through 2020 or beyond.","21621":"Starts off tighter and less giving than the regular Mort's Block, only gradually displaying its greater potential longevity. Offers crushed stone and lime notes, medium body and a clean green apple and citrus finish right now, but expect it to develop petrol, honey and toast notes within the next several years; drink now\u20132017.","21747":"This medium-bodied Shiraz is sturdily built without being too hard or too fat. Sure, it's a bit simple, relying on black cherry and plum fruit with modest hints of chocolate and spice, but there's plenty of intensity for the price.","21806":"Sourced entirely from Tasmania, the 2011 Yattarna shows a richer style than some other recent vintages while still retaining exceptional freshness and length. Roasted nuts and grilled citrus dominate, and the palate is plump and silky in texture. Drink now\u20132020. Ten cases imported.","21828":"Jindalee's 2007 is a medium-bodied Shiraz with slightly candied fruit and a sensation of sweetness on the short, soft finish.","21831":"Thickly textured and sweet, with simple fruity flavors of cherries, strawberries and watermelon.","21843":"De Bortoli almost always seems to emphasize the savory side of wine, and this Heathcote Shiraz stays true to that philosophy. Black olive and espresso notes speak of Shiraz, while the the structure remains tight and firm on the finish. This should age well through at least 2020.","21973":"A little less austere and easier to drink than many dry Aussie Rieslings, this wine features lime and vanilla shadings on the nose, and ample apple, melon and citrus flavors. It's fullish and round, despite only 12.5% alcohol, with a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now\u20132010.","21987":"The color is dark and dense and so are the aromas, which show plenty of vanilla oak and mulberry fruit. As you might expect from winemaker Ben Glaetzer and the Mitolo family, this is a full-bodied Shiraz, albeit not quite as lush and riveting as the 2005 version. The tannins this year are soft, the acids a bit on the tart side, giving the fruit a crisp edge. Probable drinking window: 2010\u20132020.","21994":"Marlargo appears to be a reasonably successful attempt at fashioning a pan-Australian brand, sourcing fruit from different parts of the country. This Clare Riesling starts with scents of talcum powder and lime sherbet, then follows those up with similar flavors. It's muscular and taut, even a bit austere, clocking in at only 11.4% alcohol. May develop through 2015.","22054":"Fleeting hints of rose petals add allure to this wine's aromas of black cherries, cola and spice. Unlike some Tasmanian Pinots, it's generous and round in the mouth, with warm spice notes combining with plum and cola on the finish. Drink now.","22097":"This ripe yet varietally true style features scents of baked pear, ripe melon, cinnamon and allspice. This is plump but lacking true depth, finishing short.","22360":"Full bodied, muscular and intense, this brooding Shiraz is built for the cellar. Smoke and blackberries are crunchy with acid and primary fruit, finishing crisp. Drink 2018\u20132025.","22466":"This vintage of the Reiver seems mintier than others, and at times the mint seemed a dominant feature of this wine, which otherwise offers jammy berry fruit and chocolate aromas and flavors. At 15% abv, it's not a shy wine, but neither is it as richly textured as might be expected. Drink it 2013\u20132020.","22476":"Named for the famous Shiraz-growing district at the north end of the Barossa Valley, Penfolds' Kalimna Shiraz is in fact a multiregional South Australian blend that aims to recreate the Kalimna style. It succeeds admirably, albeit without the intensity and complexity that marks the best Barossan Shirazes, combining raspberries with touches of plum and prune before turning chocolaty on the finish. Drink now\u20132015.","22660":"Looking for something different to serve with your cheese course? This aged white might be just the thing. Scents of grape skins and honey waft from the glass, followed by flavors akin to honey, beeswax and bitter almond. It tastes like there's a hint of residual sugar as well.","22661":"Give this wine a brief stay in a decanter to help blow off some of the tarry notes and it should be fine. It's full-bodied and creamy, with mocha and black-fruit flavors that finish plush and soft. Drink now.","22736":"Made in a soft, user-friendly style, the 2008 DB Family Selection Petite Sirah offers up a flavorful mouthful of plum and baking spices. It's medium-bodied, with a silkiness to the structure that belies the grape variety, yet that same softness makes it immediately appealing. Drink now.","22910":"Not many $30 wines can offer fruit from 100-year-old vines, but this one does. It's full bodied and rich, with notes of plum and black cherries supported by hints of chocolate and vanilla. With its long, velvety finish, there's no reason to defer gratification, although it should drink well through at least 2020.","22911":"Appropriately youthful and flashy, this is textbook Barossa Shiraz, full bodied and rich. Dusty tannins and mouthwatering acids support dark berry fruit, cedar and vanilla. It's drinkable now, but should add savoriness over the next 10 or more years.","23117":"The mint, cassis and baking spice aromas are classic New World Cabernet, as is the wine's ample body and creamy texture. By purist standards, it's too drinkable, too approachable now, with tannins that just glide into the background. Drink now\u20132020.","23194":"Like all the Duval wines, this is amply structured. Cedar and vanilla notes frame dark fruit flavors in this blend of 51% Shiraz, 30% Grenache and 19% Mourv\u00e8dre. Its full bodied, with a long, dusty finish. Drink now\u20132022.","23201":"The blend of 56% Grenache and 40% Shiraz also includes 4% Sagrantino, said to enhance structure. For its size, the wine is remarkably restrained, combining slightly resinous cherry fruit with hints of cinnamon, clove and mint. The finish is supple, suggesting early drinkability. Enjoy now\u20132017.","23210":"For the price, this offers much more depth and structure than expected. Dark berry fruit, vanilla and cedar mark the nose, while there's plenty of weight and richness on the palate. Drink now\u20132025.","23256":"Just tiny amounts of this wine (25 cases) are available in the U.S. market, but it represents a trend in Australia of celebrating old-vine Grenache. A blend of two parcels from the Blewitt Springs and Seaview subregions, this is silky in texture, with crisp red cherries shot through with herbal streaks and a slightly warm finish.","23538":"Classic hints of mint mark the black-cherry and cassis aromas of this wine. On the palate, the fruit is reasonably restrained but pure, barely touched by dried spices and cedar, then glides to a silky finish. Drink now\u20132020.","23545":"Made with enough skin contact to yield a gentle coppery hue, this medium-bodied wine features aromas of cantaloupe, cherry and citrus. Cherry fruit on the palate is accompanied by vaguely Pinot Noir-like notes of dried bracken and moss, then glides to a long, silky finish. Drink now.","23852":"This is a reliable bottling for lovers of Barossa Shiraz who don't want to drop more than a Jackson. It's full bodied and plush, with layers of blackberry fruit and vanilla oak, yet remains vibrant on the mocha-tinged finish. Drink now\u20132020.","23914":"A unique dessert wine made from botrytized S\u00e9millon that's then fortified and aged for an average of eight years in barrel, this is a dark, coffee-brown wine, with a hint of green to its rim. Aromas are slightly nutty and molasses-like, with raisiny, almost Muscat-like flavors. Full-bodied and rich, it finishes long and sticky.","24014":"Always one of Yalumba's top offerings, the 2008 doesn't show any of the vintage's ill effects. Instead, this blend of Cabernet (56%) and Shiraz (44%) offers a rich, open-knit mouthful of chocomint and dark plum, underscored by savory, meaty notes. This is full bodied and supple, yet muscular, with at least a decade of cellaring potential.","24237":"Long Flat, once an entry-level tier of Tyrell's in the Hunter Valley, is now a brand of its own, sourcing fruit from a wide range of GIs. The Coonawarra Cabernet is soft and plushly textured, with hints of roasted fruit, leather, mocha and tobacco. Drink now.","24484":"This is a fine example of what Barossa Shiraz is capable of at a realistic price. It's full bodied and richly textured, plush without being too soft. French oak brings a smoky, bacony element to the ripe blueberry fruit, plus a dusting of baking spices that lingers on the finish. Drink now\u20132025.","24520":"At first, this wine seems fruity and direct, loaded with dark berry fruit. But over time, it develops more and more oak character, adding notes of cedar, vanilla and mint. It's creamy in texture, with silky tannins, but remains a bit woody on the finish.","24523":"As one might expect from a Rh\u00f4ne-based producer, this is a meaty, earthy rendering of Shiraz. It's only medium bodied, but frames its black olive and spice flavors in dry, dusty tannins. Drink now\u20132020.","24542":"It's refreshing to see another importer take a chance on Pinot Noir from the Adelaide Hills, a region that can reliably ripen the variety at reasonable crop loads. This is a rounder, more supple style of Pinot than most from Australia, with cola, spice and cherry notes reminiscent of Dr. Pepper, or of some Pinots from California's Russian River Valley. Drink now\u20132020.","24544":"Despite its modest alcohol level, this bottling speaks of ripe fruit. Lime and bergamot aromas bring a floral element, while the flavors are of tangerine and nectarine. A touch of residual sugar adds roundness to the mouthfeel.","24609":"This light- to medium-weight wine is drinkable now\u2014try it with Coffin Bay oysters if you can\u2014but should also age well for up to 15 years. Notes of citrus, lime and crushed stone are mouthwatering and refreshing.","24611":"There aren't many better values in ros\u00e9 sparklers than this. Hints of toast and citrus add nuance to strawberry scents on the nose, while brioche notes add depth to the palate. It's a bit creamy in texture, yet remains dry and refreshing on the finish.","24614":"This starts off with scents of melon and wet stone. A sense of plumpness unfolds on the attack, then accelerates across the palate in a burst of bright, citrusy acids. A tactile, silky edge to the finish adds length and complexity.","24620":"Pike's top Riesling features aromas of crushed stone and damp moss, while the flavors bring to mind tangy limes and underripe nectarines. It's actually a bit rounder in feel than expected, then gains focus on the long finish.","24623":"Byrne is a relatively young Clare Valley producer, having made its own wines only since 2008. This Reserve Cabernet features some charred oak and espresso notes on the nose, then ripe, plummy fruit on the palate. It's full bodied, dusty and extracted, boasting plenty of intensity, but lacking polish in this youthful state. It should improve for at least the next five years or so.","24628":"This is full and rich but not overly heavy or sweet, coming across as similar to a well-balanced peach compote or cobbler. Hints of mushroon, cinnamon and clove add depth and complexity.","24631":"Winemaker Kevin Mitchell has been gradually refining his style, pulling back on alcohol and oak without sacrificing fruit intensity. This is a fruit-driven Cabernet, loaded with black cherries and cassis and supported by restrained, just-right oak levels. It's medium-bodied, softly dusty yet firm, with a surprisingly long finish. Drink now\u20132025.","24837":"Named for the special format of small oak barrel it's aged in, this has soaked up the oak impressively. Hints of vanilla and graham crackers accent mixed berry fruit, while the finish is long and mouthwatering. There's ample concentration, yet the wine never seems heavy. Drinkable now, but why rush things? Drink 2020\u20132030.","25256":"A blend of 69% Cabernet and 31% Shiraz, Yalumba's 2004 The Reserve is still firm and dusty on the finish, suggesting at least another 2\u20133 years of cellaring are warranted. Cassis, caramel, earth and vanilla notes are all nicely integrated into a cohesive whole, with the result being a dark, chocolaty wine that's savory as much as it is fruity.","25268":"From its floral, lime-driven aromas to its citrus and baked-apple flavors, this is a textbook Riesling. It's plump and friendly, offering a mouthfilling texture and easy-drinking appeal at a bargain price. Drink now.","25283":"A pleasant surprise, this budget-priced Viognier shows plenty of plump fruit without getting overly big or blowsy. Citrus and pineapple flavors reflect the moderate alcohol levels, finishing on a juicy, succulent note. Drink now.","25364":"An unoaked Chardonnay, Marlargo's Gypsy Spirit shows plenty of fruit, ranging from melon to nectarine and pineapple. It even shows decent texture for an unoaked Chardonnay, something that's not always easy to accomplish. Drink now.","25395":"Duval used to make Grange, so it is no surprise that his current luxury Shiraz is so successful. The 2008 Eligo oozes with oaky sweetness\u2014vanilla, maple syrup and brown sugar notes\u2014but balances that with potent cassis fruit and somehow ends on dry, savory notes of tobacco and spice. Drink now-2018, although it could surprise and go longer.","25434":"This is a full-bodied, creamy-textured Shiraz that manages to retain a sense of poise at the same time. Cedar, vanilla and baking spices frame a lush mix of red and black berry fruit, yet this is no mere fruit bomb, adding hints of roast meat and mocha. Drink this plush, supple wine now\u20132025.","25442":"Extraordinarily delicious is more like it. This is full bodied, supple and rich, with luscious aromas and flavors of mocha, cassis and vanilla that finish long, with some soft, dusty tannins. With all the plushness and primary fruit, it seems a little young right now; drink 2018\u20132030.","25556":"The lightest of the 2012 single-vineyard Pinot Noirs from Giant Steps, this is an almost delicate wine with silky tannins. Notes of smoke, earth and mushroom mark the nose, while hints of pine boughs impart a slightly medicinal edge to the cherry fruit. Drink now.","25658":"An excellent value, this is a fairly full-bodied, slightly creamy-textured Shiraz that should provide ample pleasure through 2020. Smoky, plummy fruit finishes warm and plush.","25762":"A decent Chardonnay for the price, with pineapple fruit and hints of butter and cream. It's medium in body, with a slightly custardy mouthfeel and a short finish. Drink now.","25763":"Soft and creamy in style, with aromas and flavors of pineapple and ginger. Off dry on the finish.","25780":"This blend of Semillon, Traminer, Shiraz and Frontignac (a form of Muscat) features orange, berry and spice aromas and sweet flavors not unlike berry sherbet, with just a squeeze of citrus on the finish. Soft and frothy; drink now.","25883":"The price is right for this lush, immediately attractive Shiraz from Victoria. Smoky, vanilla-scented oak frames black currant and tobacco flavors that finish soft and velvety. Lacks the depth to age past 2010, but very flattering now. Imported by Epic Wines.","26171":"This is an impressively endowed wine, but one that will have to rely on age for its complexity. Right now, its fruit (blackberries and cassis) is a bit simple upfront, then adds crisp acidity and firm tannins on the finish. Try in 2010.","26172":"This French-Australian collaboration has turned out a soft, easy-to-drink Merlot with notable complexity. Cassis and black cherry fruit is backed by shadings of cedar and vanilla and eased along by a creamy texture and supple tannins. Without any track record, it's probably prudent to drink this over the next few years.","26188":"The blend includes just 14% Mourv\u00e8dre, with the balance split evenly between Shiraz and Grenache, and the result is a medium-bodied red with soft tannins and plenty of ripe fruit. Blackberry, plum and spice notes show good concentration and some chocolaty overtones. Drink now and over the next several years.","26228":"The 2003 Cliff Edge Shiraz shows plenty of intensity: bright cranberry-raspberry fruit, bold notes of cured meat and overtones of cedary oak. Tannins are supple, the structural underpinnings reliant on crisp acids instead. Use that tartness to offset some of the richness of stews or roasts.","26240":"Tahbilk, one of Australia's historic wineries, has turned out a velvety-textured Shiraz named for one of the company's long-time winemakers. This is a medium-bodied, yet velvety-soft Shiraz that boasts plenty of intensity. If its blackberry, licorice and vanilla flavors develop more complexity over the next few years, the 89 rating may seem stingy.","26562":"Musky, spicy notes of pineapple and clove set the stage, expanding on the palate alongside waves of cinnamon, vanilla and peach. It's relatively full in body, with a silky texture and a long, clean, refreshing finish. Drink now\u20132025.","26571":"This is a ripe Clare Valley Riesling, but it balances its peachy overtones with powerful citrus zest and hints of crushed stone. There's a touch of roundness to the midpalate, then plenty of length on the finish.","26584":"As always at Leeuwin Estate, the Art Series Chardonnay is a star. Now incorporating some natural ferments and slightly more solids, the 2013 features some more savory elements than in the past. A hint of pencil shavings highlights the pear and pineapple fruit, which offers plenty of flesh without being overbearing.","26737":"Howard Park's single-vineyard Cabernet and Shiraz bottlings offer consistently good value for the money. The 2005 Scotsdale Shiraz delivers layers of mixed berries, baking spices and hints of dried fruit and toasty oak. It's full-bodied, lush and creamy-textured in the mouth, with a long finish powered by fruit and shaped by dusty tannins. Drink now-2020.","27140":"This is a tough wine to evaluate. On the one hand, there's plenty of concentration and ripeness, reflected in the wine's high-toned raspberry fruit, ample weight and rich, creamy texture. On the other hand, the alcohol is a bit elevated (16%) and there's almost 1.5% residual sugar, so it's sweet on the finish.","27174":"Pie cherry and rhubarb notes make a bright impression on the nose, followed by tart flavors bundled in a mocha-tinged wrapper. The texture is almost syrupy on the midpalate, but turns dry and dusty on the finish. This is a bit disjointed at this stage, so perhaps it will improve with cellaring. Try after 2018.","27462":"Savory, meaty notes marry nicely with plummy fruit and clove spice in this wonderfully supple example of Yarra Valley Shiraz. With extended aeration, this wine develops lots of smoky, ashy notes\u2014a possible side effect of nearby bush fires\u2014so I'd opt for drinking it over the next couple of years.","27631":"The offbeat, savory nose is certainly complex, and the flavors follow in a similar vein, showing hints of onion and soft-ripened cheese. It's light in body, with a touch of residual sugar and a short finish.","27692":"Richly tropical in nature, with ripe flavors suggesting peaches and mangoes framed by lingering hints of butter and toast. It's a plump, amply endowed version of this wine, but may not be as long lived as some other vintages. Drink now\u20132010.","27730":"Another faintly copper-hued Pinot Grigio from the Oatley family, this one offers modest apple, melon and citrus notes, medium body and a slightly tannic edge to the tart, lemony finish. Drink now.","27821":"An easy-to-drink, burger and pizza sort of Shiraz, with slightly uneven notes of ripe and raisined fruit and soft acids and tannins.","27996":"A sweetly ripe amalgam of cassis, vanilla and cedar, this medium-bodied Cabernet is pleasant enough, if a little lacking in distinctiveness. It turns faintly dusty on the finish, making it suited to pair with burgers or steak.","28104":"This is surprisingly plump and accessible, featuring scents of lime rind upfront, then flavors of apple, nectarine and citrus. A medium-bodied wine with a long, mouthwatering finish, it's a tasty near-term drinker but should develop well for up to 10 years.","28157":"With its knockout nose of blackberries and baking spices, this is an instant stunner. It follows that overture with complex flavors in a similar theme. It's full bodied and mouthcoating in intensity. The only question mark is whether the firm tannins will help it mature gracefully or leave it with a persistent drying quality on the finish. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited.","28167":"Ripe black cherry and cedary aromas can't hide the touch of alcohol that seems to emanate from the glass. But the wine is balanced on the palate, not showing any excessive warmth, framing its black cherry and chocolate flavors with bright acidity. The crisp acids on the finish accentuate the tannins, making this an uncommonly structured Grenache. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited.","28173":"A full-bodied, mouthfilling wine, Giaconda's 2005 Aeolia Roussanne showcases aromas of toasted cashews, then balances them against bold peach and citrus fruit. The oak lends a slightly charred quality to the wine, which comes through on the finish as a hint of espresso. Drink now and over the next few years.","28174":"This 60-40 blend provides excellent value at this price. It's full-bodied but silky-soft in texture, with aromas and flavors that range from plum to earth and cola to dried spices. The tannins melt away on the palate, leaving behind a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now.","28178":"This wine nicely captures Pinot Noir's elusive silky texture and weight without heaviness, then combines those attributes with complex earthy flavors and touches of sassafras and cola. Finishes long, with hints of maraschino cherries and caramel. Drink now\u20132014.","28185":"This blend of 70% Grenache, 25% Shiraz and 5% Mourv\u00e8dre features surprisingly dark fruit flavors akin to blackberries and cola. A hint of mint or eucalyptus enlivens the bouquet and helps to lighten this otherwise rather full-bodied, brooding wine. Finishes long, with enough dusty tannins to warrant cellaring through 2015.","28233":"Smoky and meaty, this is aggressively savory in style, but really evolves with air to show a gentler, raspberry-fruited side accented by dried spices. It's medium- to full- bodied, with a slightly creamy texture and silky, mouthwatering finish. Terrific cool-climate Shiraz.","28374":"Comes out of the chute showing a funky, rubbery edge, but that blows off with a little time to reveal dark, somewhat earthy notes of cola and blackberry. It's medium-bodied, with good length to the finish, where it picks up enough dusty tannins to give it backbone.","28492":"Deep golden straw in color, with modest aromas of struck flint and pear. The flavors are reminiscent of buttery, honeyed pears, yet stay tart from start to finish. Perplexing.","28603":"This innovative blend of 60% S\u00e9millon and 40% Marsanne doesn't show the hoped-for synergies. Hints of tar and rubber refuse to blow off completely, and the modest green apple and citrus flavors come across as lean and emaciated on the palate.","28619":"Astralis has become one of Australia's top collectibles, and Roman Bratasiuk's 2005 version is once again top-shelf stuff. It's full-bodied and rich without being over the top, balancing dark-chocolate-covered blackberries and blueberries with more complex savory notes (spice, grilled meat). While it's a big, hulking wine at first, the finish shows great elegance and finesse, ending with silky tannins. Best from 2014. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited.","29270":"One of the closest things there is to a can't-miss wine, Leeuwin's Chardonnay is always on form. The 2011 Art Series is flamboyantly oaked, with smoky, toasty, nutty notes layered over hints of white peach and grilled pineapple. It's less rich than some vintages have been, but still appealingly mealy in texture. Drink now\u20132020.","29271":"This is remarkably lush and full-bodied, yet remains lively and mouthwatering. Toasted nuts frame ample flavors of grilled pineapple and melon. Drink now\u20132017. The success of this wine should be a good indicator that, when released, the 2012 Art Series will be something spectacular.","29320":"Despite its relatively low alcohol level, this comes across as reasonably mouthfilling and rich. Smoky notes from barrel fermentation emerge with air, accenting white nectarine and citrus fruit. It's one of the few blends of this type to show the textural interest of a good white Graves.","29680":"This full-throttle blend of Grenache, Shiraz and Mourv\u00e8dre comes across as almost Zinfandel-like, with bold, briary fruit and hints of damp earth. Shows a bit of warmth on the finish, but also a flourish of bright berry fruit. Drink now and over the next several years.","29823":"Endowed with plenty of fruit, this wine swirls together notes of raspberry and vanilla, then tops off that delicious blend with hints of mint and other herbs. The lovely creamy texture turns silky and fresh on the finish. Drink now\u20132020.","29831":"Bin 389 is always a Cab-Shiraz, although the 2009 is only just, at 51% Cabernet and 49% Shiraz. This year's version is chocolaty and ripe, with plenty of weight and a slightly creamy feel. Cassis and vanilla notes fill out the palate, which finishes long, with an elegant texture akin to fine suede. Drink now\u20132025.","29841":"Classic Cabernet, from its mint and cassis aromas to its ample weight and long, plush finish. This is full and velvety, with hints of cedar and vanilla blending easily into the whole. Approachable now, it should age well through at least 2025.","29910":"This medium-bodied Shiraz is supple, immediately drinkable and complex\u2014what more could one want for under $15? Find plummy fruit, meaty elements, cracked pepper and hints of mocha and a long, savory finish here.","29913":"Marked by potent aromas of green apple and lime sherbet, this is an intense, flavorful Riesling that just lacks that little bit of finesse. It's dry and medium-bodied, with a slightly oily, slightly coarse texture. Drink it young.","29927":"This medium-bodied Shiraz is almost Saint Joseph-like in its charming cherry and cracked pepper flavors. It's not overly rich or complex, just an easy-drinking wine that should offer plenty of appeal over the next few years.","30207":"This wine is dark and inky in color. Nearly impenetrable at first on the nose, this reluctantly giving up hints of plum, cocoa and earth. The plum-pudding palate is dense and weighty, with savory overtones. Give it until 2018 or 2020 to unclench and brighten up.","30289":"This boasts some rather prominent herbal (dill, perhaps?) notes, but this is an otherwise creamy-textured, soft Cabernet meant for immediate consumption. Vanilla and black cherry notes start upfront and persist through the slightly warm finish.","30450":"Pretty grippy stuff, with astringent tannins accentuated by tart acids. Mint, cassis and cigar box elements pick up mocha notes on the finish.","30566":"No doubt the screw cap closure has contributed to this wine's longevity. Even more than 18 months after bottling, it still comes across as crisp and refreshing. Notes of tangerine, melon rind and strawberry offer plenty of appeal. Still, I wouldn't wait any longer.","30940":"The Clare Valley is an underappreciated source of fine Cabernet Sauvignon, and this is one of the region's standard bearers. Minty notes add a dose of Australia to this slightly austere wine, which also boasts dark chocolate, cassis and tobacco. Drink 2015\u20132025.","31003":"Consulting winemaker Ben Glaetzer has fashioned a reasonably full-bodied Cab for the Mitolo family, one that combines some superripe, verging on raisined, elements with hints of tobacco and herbs. Mint, cassis and chocolate round out the palate, finishing softly tannic. Drink now\u20132010.","31018":"Scents of leather, cola and brown sugar give way to cleaner, fruitier notes of blackberry on the palate, marked by ample vanilla oak. A blend of 78% Cab Sauvignon, 19% Merlot and 3% Cab Franc, it's medium-bodied and fresh, with a slightly minty finish framed by soft tannins.","31021":"Boasts tremendously ripe fruit\u2014the stated alcohol level is 15.5%\u2014yet doesn't seem overly hot or bulky. As you might expect, the tannins are soft, while the flavors of cassis pick up hints of cola, earth and tobacco. Despite the ripeness, there's a streak of tangy acidity that holds everything together. Drink now.","31303":"At 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a firm, cassis-scented wine, but one that includes hints of ripeness and generous fruit. Dried herbs and brown sugar add nuance, while the velvety finish picks up some meaty, savory notes. Drink now\u20132025.","31372":"This is a relatively simple, fruity quaff, filled to the brim with pears, apples and melons. It's medium-bodied, with a bit of apple- or pear-skin texture that gives it additional interest. Drink now.","31377":"This is muscular and sturdy for a Pinot Noir, with savory notes of mushrooms, beets and earth that add to that impression. While it lacks precision and elegance, it does offer a chunky mouthful of Pinot with ample length and intensity to the finish.","31397":"An inky wine, yet remarkably well balanced and supple, marrying a lush, creamy texture with masses of blueberries and hints of mint and licorice. Drink now or hold up to 10 years.","31621":"At only 6%, the Mataro is mostly window-dressing, but this blend of Grenache (52%) and Shiraz (42%) is still a tasty mouthful. Toast and cedar notes frame black cherry and plum fruit in this full-bodied, lushly textured wine. Drink now\u20132018.","31946":"This oak-free Chardonnay combines pear and tropical fruit flavors in a somewhat simple but pleasant package. Shows some oiliness to its texture and a touch of warmth on the finish, but it's a good effort overall.","32049":"This compelling wine delivers a tidal wave of chocolate, dark berries, earth and black olive aromas and flavors. It's huge in the mouth yet amazingly supple in texture, leaving no sense of excessive weight or alcohol. Hints of toast, menthol and coffee linger on the surprisingly elegant finish. Drink now-2025.","32058":"From vines planted more than a century ago, this richly concentrated, voluptuous wine blossoms with time in the glass, revealing aromas of brandied black cherries and dark chocolate. The tannins are creamy smooth, the length on the palate prodigious. But at 15.5% alcohol, this wine's warmth is noticeable; opt for drinking it over the next 10 years.","32302":"A tart, tangy Shiraz of only medium weight, this wine offers only moderately complex flavors of plum, tinged with coffee, leather and black olive.","32304":"Despite its moderate alcohol level, this comes across as medium to full in body, with a velvet and custard texture that coats the palate with flavors of grilled pineapple, citrus and melon. It's made in a concentrated, opulent style, yet it finishes clean, with lingering notes of citrus. Drink now through 2020.","32338":"A good value, this starts off a little shaky thanks to some barnyard scents on the nose, then rights itself. Herbal-tobacco notes accent plum-prune flavors in this medium-bodied wine with a creamy-smooth texture. Soft and easygoing, it's ideal to drink now.","32346":"This Cabernet fits the steakhouse red formula to a T. Ripe, lusty fruit\u2014blackberry in this case\u2014is matched by a big whack of vanillin oak. It's not the most complex wine, but offers plenty of full-bodied, softly tannic flavor. Drink now\u20132012.","32355":"A very good showing for this wine, which should be on all value-conscious shoppers' lists. Mint accents black cherry and cassis fruit enriched by some chocolaty notes. Tannins are plentiful but ripe, giving it the necessary heft to stand up to grilled steak.","32386":"The not-so-secret blend is 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Shiraz and 12% Malbec, yielding a dark plummy wine with ample palate weight and softly dusty tannins. Espresso and black olive shadings give this a savory cast, making it more an accompaniment to food than a standalone sipper. Drink now through 2019.","32476":"Not as wild as the name suggests, this is a full-bodied, rather weighty wine, but one that stays within normal bounds. Black cherry fruit is tinged with mocha and baking spices, ending in a dusting of soft tannins. Drink now\u20132018. The blend is 42% Shiraz, 36% Grenache and 22% Mataro.","32492":"This blend of 45% Shiraz, 30% Grenache and 25% Mourv\u00e8dre is full bodied and supple, not heavy or overextracted. Herb notes accent cherry fruit, while hints of mocha creep in on the finish. Enjoy this easy-drinking wine now\u20132017.","32674":"This medium- to full-bodied white features a richly textured mouthfeel to go with its toasty aromas and melon fruit. There's a touch of creamed-corn character, and the finish could be longer, but it's still a plump, satisfying wine to pair with chicken or fish.","32973":"This style of simply yummy, quaffable wine is what Australian Grenache is so capable of producing. Despite high alcohol (16.5%), it doesn't show heat on the palate, instead offering oodles of black cherries and some accents of baking spices. It's round, supple and easy to drink, with a touch of coffee on the finish. Imported by USA Wine West.","32984":"This plump, medium-bodied Chardonnay boasts aromas and flavors of smoke and grilled pineapple. It may be a little on the simple side, but it's well done, combining ample varietal character with an appetizing bit of oak.","32988":"Delivers rather standard Chardonnay aromas and flavors, ranging from hints of toast to ripe peaches and pineapple. It's nicely balanced, showing some lush texture on the midpalate yet retaining citrusy freshness on the finish. Well done, and well priced. Drink now.","33031":"From vines that were 79 years old when the fruit was harvested, this is made in a deliberately lean style to encourage cellaring. Notes of lemon, crushed stone and apple skin are taut and dry, with a dusty, tactile sensation on the finish. Drink now, or hold through at least 2020 to allow for more development.","33159":"Slightly confectionary, with cinnamon and vanilla notes alongside cherries and caramel. Finishes with a touch of warmth.","33255":"Melon and pear notes provide the flesh, while a citrusy element provides the backbone of this medium-bodied Chardonnay. It's round without being flabby, ending on a refreshing, citrusy note. Drink now.","33353":"Shows plenty of red fruit character, starting with cherry but encompassing strawberry as well. It's plump and round in the mouth, but refreshingly modest in alcohol (13.1%), finishing clean. The winery says it's made from Fragola, which turns out to be an American variety known as Isabella. Imported by Margaret River Wines.","33648":"This wine represents an excellent value, and one that showcases the quality potential of Langhorne Creek. It's creamy in texture, voluptuous in feel and full in body, with a bold flavor of red currant that's framed by ample cedar and vanilla notes. Long and creamy on the finish. Drink now\u20132018.","33668":"The 2009 Diana Madeline is 88% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance a blend of Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec. It boasts lovely aromas of cassis and tobacco leaf or dried herb, while on the palate it is restrained. For all of the aromatic boldness and purity, it's a bit austere, ending on a firm, crisp note. A 2002 tasted recently was just hitting its stride, so give it another 6\u20138 years.","33669":"Primarily Cabernet Sauvignon (the balance is Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc), this is full bodied, lush and richly textured. Cassis, blackberry, vanilla and tobacco leaf notes give this a convincingly Bordeaux-styled profile, although much riper and plusher. Drink now\u20132023.","33714":"For the price, this is an impressively detailed and complex wine. Floral notes reminiscent of lavender or rosemary mark the nose and impart interest to the palate, which deftly marries herbs, baking spices and dark fruit. Crisp acids combine with soft tannins on the silky finish. Drink now\u20132022.","33719":"This seems a bit oaky on the nose, where scents of baking spices and cedar dominate, but those elements are balanced out on the palate, where blackberries, plums and black currants comes to the fore. This is a full-bodied, ripe-textured wine worth a look. Drink now\u20132025.","33729":"Made with enough skin contact to yield a gentle coppery hue, this medium-bodied wine features aromas of cantaloupe, cherry and citrus. Cherry fruit on the palate is accompanied by vaguely Pinot Noir-like notes of dried bracken and moss, then glides to a long, silky finish. Drink now.","33761":"Excessively volatile, with some briary, berry-like fruit that's overwhelmed by slightly pickle-y notes. It's medium in body, but thins out on the finish.","33764":"Muted on the nose, with flavors of apple and white gumdrops, and finishing with hints of butter and anise.","34048":"Dark and smoky on the nose, with meat, cedar and blackberries combining into an attractive bouquet. This is a meaty, savory wine that should drink well from 2010\u20132020, backed by tart blackberries and showing some dusty tannins on the finish.","34162":"This full-bodied yet silky Shiraz delivers tremendous elegance for its size. It's complex as well, boasting aromas that range from vanilla and brown sugar through to marinated beef and raspberry compote. The richly-textured finish lingers for minutes. Drink now\u20132025.","34163":"Mouthfilling and supple, this is a top-notch example of Barossa Shiraz. Despite the soft tannins, the fruit is bright and lively, with tart red plum and raspberry notes at the core, surrounded by hints of vanilla and mint. Long and vibrant on the finish, this is drinkable already, but should age well through at least 2025.","34227":"This was a perplexing wine to evaluate. The aromas feature toasted hazelnuts, lemon curd, pineapple and more than a hint of banana bread. The flavors follow in a similar vein, but are exaggerated, coming across as strongly tropical and confected, then drawing to a crisp finish.","34248":"This medium-weight, slightly austere Riesling boasts aromas of struck flint and lime, with flavors of citrus and underripe stone fruit. Drink it now with raw oysters.","34301":"It's nice to see the quality of this wine reach new heights, as it's still relatively affordable within the Henschke context. The blend includes Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. The 2013 shows a slightly austere side, an aristocratic reserve, but the flavors are classic. Pencil shavings, mint, cassis and cigar box finish with great drive, length and dusty tannins. Drink 2023\u20132035.","34317":"A classic blend of Cabernet and Shiraz, this is cedary and complex upon opening, easily mixing cassis, plum and blackberry with vanilla and baking spices. On the palate, it's dense and concentrated yet slightly reserved, suggesting rather than screaming its potential. A long, mocha-tinged finish wraps things up, combining dusty tannins with mouthwatering acids. Drink 2020\u20132030+.","34542":"This prodigious wine showcases Barossa's ability to deliver big, mouthfilling flavors without any suggestion of heat or heaviness. Scents of stone fruit, pepper and red currants mark the nose, while the flavors take on a darker cast, heading toward black cherries and black olives. The tannins are supremely silky, but this graceful, feminine beauty should drink well through at least 2020.","34546":"If Standish's Relic is the feminine side of Shiraz, this is in a more masculine vein, with slightly coarser tannins and more weight, but still possessing great intensity without any heaviness. Cassis, blueberry and black olive flavors are tinged with hints of asphalt and espresso, leading into a warm, lingering finish. Drink now-2025.","34621":"Toasty and citrusy, this is a prototypical m\u00e9thode Champenoise sparkler, blending Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier from the cool island of Tasmania, off Australia's southern coast. It's medium in weight, with a crisp lemony finish that invites a second sip.","34671":"Like an underripe nectarine, this tart, crunchy wine needs a bit time to mature. But instead of 2\u20133 days, think 2\u20133 years. Lime and mandarin orange notes are lean and crisp on the palate, austere for now, but surely going to blossom in time.","34683":"Although Cullen's latest red wines haven't always impressed, the quality of the Chardonnay seems to go from great to even greater. This is plump enough to be appealing now, yet with a strong frame of acidity to hold it together for the next 10 or more years. Toasted nuts and fresh pineapple aromas and flavors are exotic upfront, while the lemony finish is long and mouthwatering.","34938":"Hints of honey, citrus and petrol mark the aromas of this wine from a legendary Eden Valley estate. It's a medium-bodied rendition of Riesling, dry and petrolly, with a long, concentrated finish that suggests that this wine could safely be cellared for up to 10 years.","35071":"Yalumba's mastery of Viognier extends even to this botrytis-affected dessert style, which offers scents and flavors of honey, dried apricots and orange marmalade. It's not overly complex, but wonderfully concentrated yet balanced, with a long, honeyed finish. Drink it over the next few years.","35201":"This is slightly bigger and bolder than the 2009 Art Series Cabernet, but remains a relatively streamlined and silky rendering of the variety. Potent cedar and vanilla notes frame dark fruit aromas and flavors, while the finish lingers, echoing with wood overtones. Drink now\u20132025.","35204":"This is textbook Clare Valley dry Riesling, with lime sherbet aromas and flavors that come across as slightly one-dimensional at this young age. It's medium bodied, with a slightly dusty texture that's especially notable on the long finish. Drink now\u20132025.","35212":"Despite this wine's modest alcohol level, it delivers ample richness and flavor. Hints of toast and roasted nuts frame vibrant citrus fruit and a touch of white peach. It's intense and invigorating, with a burst of fresh citrus echoing on the finish.","35376":"For a late-release 2002, this is still very youthful, packing layers of rich cassis and blackberry fruit into a soft jacket of vanilla, cedar and toasted coconut. It's full-bodied, lush and velvety\u2014a simply terrific Cabernet that should prove to have excellent aging potential as well. Drink now\u20132020.","35378":"There's a noticeable background herbal element to this intensely concentrated wine. Dense layers of cassis and chocolate are front and center, filling the mouth with velvety richness and finishing long. Despite the power and richness, there's a structure to match, suggesting this will improve through at least 2012 and drink well until 2020.","35380":"Made in the winery's classically savory style, this flagship Cabernet shows a touch of bricking at the rim and some maturing aromas and flavors of tobacco, cedar and earth. It's broad and mouthfilling, creamy in texture yet not obviously fruity, finishing with lush, soft tannins and a touch of hickory smoke. Drink now\u20132015.","35381":"From veteran winemaker John Glaetzer, this Cabernet from Langhorne Creek is something of a throwback, spending some 28 months in American oak hogsheads. Yet there's clearly enough cherry and cassis fruit to support all of the vanilla and toasted coconut, and the wine finishes long and balanced. Drink 2010\u20132020.","35391":"Dark and savory in style, this Shiraz offers scents of grilled meat, black olive and plum. It's full bodied and firmly structured, finishing on a crisp peppery note. It should drink well from 2020 to 2030.","35417":"A consistent performer, Yalumba's Hand Picked Shiraz-Viognier seems slightly bigger and chunkier in 2008 than in the past, with bold fruit\u2014blueberries and blackberries\u2014accented by hints of mint. Expect some savory notes to develop over the next couple of years in bottle.","35431":"The 2007 is full bodied and rich, but not really Beast-like at this stage of its evolution. The texture is creamy, the tannins nearly silky on the long finish. Flavors of blackberry, mocha and black olive linger. Drink now\u20132018.","35440":"This wine's velvety mouthfeel sets it apart from the pack, as does the vibrancy of its dark berry fruit. Hints of vanilla and mint accent the fruit without detracting from it, as does a subtle layer of mocha. Long and layered on the finish; drink now\u20132020.","35517":"This is MLG's entry-level Shiraz, but it's no slouch. Plum and blackberry fruit, hints of black olive and espresso, decent weight and dusty tannins provide plenty of bang for the buck. Drink now\u20132020.","35564":"This lacks the underripe edge of Hunter Valley Semillon or the ripeness and breadth of Barossa Valley versions, so I guess you could say it expresses its Eden Valley terroir. That said, it's a bit neutral, with modest fig and citrus flavors that finish long and crisp.","35637":"From Margaret River in Western Australia, this is a full-bodied, impressively endowed Shiraz at a reasonable price. Superripe aromas of blackberries and licorice mark the nose, while the palate features similar flavors, supple tanins and a creamy-textured finish. Good to go now, with enough concentration to hold until 2015.","35641":"This is a full-bodied, firmly structured Shiraz with plummy, intense aromas tinged with licorice and framboise. Bits of chocolate, mint and spice accent the plum and raspberry flavors, and the wine finishes crisp, dry and deeply textured. It should drink well from now through 2015.","35723":"This wine shows a more savory side of Cabernet Sauvignon without being in any way underripe or malnourished. It's a big, ripe wine, but the mulberry and cassis fruit is marked by cinnamon and clove shadings. It finishes lush, velvety and warm, with hints of chocolaty richness. This should drink well through at least 2024, and possibly for longer if it firms up a little.","35763":"This starts off slowly, but red raspberry notes emerge after some vigorous swirling. It's full-bodied and supple, featuring some berry tea-like flavors, hints of cocoa and a fine, softly dusty finish. Drink it over the next 10 years.","35765":"This is meant to provide a counterpoint to the Tyrrell family's Hunter Valley offerings, but it retains similar sensibilities. It's a medium-weight, crisp Shiraz that features a slight herbal tinge to notes of cracked pepper and red raspberries. It finishes bright and lively; drink now\u20132025.","35788":"This wine was inadvertently tasted against a bunch of Barossa giants, so I may have underestimated it. It still held its own, delivering subtle notes of plum, cinnamon and clove, plus hints of olive and mocha. It's medium in body, with some herbal notes, yet finishes dusty and mouthwatering. Drink now\u20132028.","35795":"A bit developed already, with a round mouthfeel and some honey character accented by citrus and gingery-peppery spice. Pleasant to drink now, but seems to lack the vivacity for extended aging.","36078":"The oak treatment stands out a little in this wine, imparting a dusty, wood-smoke component as well as plenty of vanilla. The cherry fruit is otherwise nicely presented, with ample weight and a touch of creaminess to the texture.","36090":"The relatively cool Adelaide Hills are making a name for their Sauvignon Blanc, and this example shows a restrained, grassy bouquet and flavors of grapefruit and tangerine. It's plump on the midpalate, then almost razor-sharp on the finish. Drink now.","36377":"Loaded with ripe pear, muskmelon and tropical fruit, this is a medium-bodied, plump white with crowd appeal. It seems a bit off dry, but closes on a citrusy note.","36464":"A bit spicier than the other R Wines Shirazes, the 2007 Boarding Pass features mainly McLaren Vale fruit, offering blackberry tinged with coffee and peppery spice. Turns tart, tangy, almost a bit citrusy on the finish.","36693":"Despite a nose and palate that delivers plenty of mixed citrus fruit, this comes across as very dry. It's lemony and crisp on the long, austere finish. Drink now with oysters, or cellar for 5\u201310 years.","36694":"The Art Series Cabernet seems to be increasing in quality nearly every vintage. The 2012 boasts plenty of sweet, cedary oak, but backs that up with layers of red currant fruit and hints of bay leaf. It's silky and harmonious on the finish, adding tea-like notes of complexity. Drink now\u20132025.","36698":"Menzies is the name of Yalumba's Coonawarra estate, which is almost entirely devoted to Cabernet Sauvignon. Like most of the Yalumba wines, the oak levels have been pared back in recent vintages, allowing this wine's cassis fruit to to shine. Hints of tobacco, bay leaf and sage bring complexity, while the tannins are fine, adding a softly dusty feel to the long finish.","36705":"This medium-bodied wine is rich and dessert-sweet, with the warm, lush feel of the Barossa. Candied pineapple and dried pear aromas and flavors turn honeyed and long on the finish. Ready to drink.","36716":"The finest Jester Cabernet I can remember, this full-bodied yet supple wine features aromas of cassis, cedar and vanilla in fine balance. Cassis and chocolate flavors continue in the same vein, followed by a silky, long finish. Drink now\u20132028.","36737":"Really youthful, with almost grapy aromas buttressed by mocha and lifted, slightly leafy notes. This is a big wine, marked by thick, chewy tannins on the finish, but they never obscure the flavors of grape skins, tapenade and mocha. Try after 2018.","36770":"This easy-drinking Shiraz features some plummy\u2014almost pruny\u2014fruit aromas, facile plum and berry flavors, little tannin and bright acids on the finish.","37066":"This plush, fruit-driven style of Shiraz displays aromas that resemble a cross between Nilla Wafers and graham crackers spread with berry preserves. The flavors follow along similar lines, underscored by hints of chocolate and coffee on the lingering finish.","37068":"This full-bodied Shiraz starts off plummy, with oak-derived accents of smoke and vanilla. Those elements also show up on the palate, picking up additional notes of blackberry, cedar and baking spice. The texture is velvety, and the finish is long and surprisingly elegant. Drink now\u20132025.","37069":"Chunky cassis, tobacco and cedar mark the nose and palate of this textbook Cabernet. It's round in the mouth, with a long, richly textured finish that adds nuances of cocoa and dried herb. Like its close cousin from the Hickinbotham Vineyard, it can be drunk now\u20132025.","37076":"Although this probably won't be easy to locate (only 64 of the 550 cases produced were imported to the U.S.), it is worth seeking out for its full, expansive mouthfeel; intense cassis and dark chocolate flavors; and long, velvety finish. Drink now\u20132025.","37110":"A faint coppery-pink ros\u00e9, Taltarni's 2008 Tach\u00e9 is a blend of 58% Chardonnay, 37% Pinot Noir and 5% Pinot Meunier. It's lean and crisp, with a zesty, citrusy feel to the modest toast and mushroom flavors.","37338":"This manages to be plush and rich in texture while keeping the alcohol level reined in. Pineapple cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e aromas are backed up on the palate by flavors of peach and pineapple, finishing long and rich. Drink now.","37350":"Mainly Shiraz, this is dense and earthy on the nose, filled with dark fruit aromas. The flavor profile is similar, but this medium- to full-bodied red turns tart and lemony on the finish. Drink now.","37491":"Assertively toasty and nutty, this is barrel-fermented in new oak, but in 500-liter puncheons, not the smaller barriques, so that the wood doesn't overwhelm. Peach, vanilla and citrus flavors completely fill the mouth, yet remain fresh and vibrant on the finish. Drink now\u20132012. Imported by Epic Wines.","37595":"So putting \u201cReserve\u201d on a $13 bottle of wine might seem like a stretch, but the fact is what's in the bottle is very good. It's full bodied, creamy and lushly textured, with an intriguing herbal tang to the black cherry fruit, hints of vanilla and a softly dusty finish. Drink now\u20132018.","37599":"There comes a point when the pursuit of restraint becomes fruitless, and while this wine shows a wonderfully silky texture and an elegant finish, its subtle aromas and flavors of roasted cashew and citrus are indeed understated.","37902":"Peach and pineapple fruit flavors form the core of this wine, embellished by touches of smoky oak. It's a medium-bodied Chardonnay, finishing long, citrusy and crisp. Drink now.","38135":"One of the best unoaked Aussie Chardonnays I've come across, this is surprisingly full bodied and lush, boasting ample pineapple and peach fruit. If it lacks a bit of texture and complexity for not having any oak, the price more than compensates. Drink it over the next several months.","38142":"As a straightahead Aussie Riesling for drinking young alongside raw oysters, this has few equals. Scents of petrichor and fresh flower-shop greenery mingle easily on the nose, while the crispness of the high-acid backbone resounds on the palate, ending on a talc-like note.","38149":"Filled with scents and flavors of black earth, cedar and dark fruit, this impressively full-bodied wine demands to be served with something similarly big and meaty. Despite its size, it's open-knit and accessible, with just enough coarse tannins on the finish to cut the richness of beef steaks or braises.","38154":"Mint notes accent blueberry and plum fruit, while hints of tar and black olive add a savory edge. This medium- to full-bodied Shiraz is creamy on the midpalate, but firms up enough on the finish to pair well with burgers or steaks. Drink now\u20132020.","38158":"Evaluating young Eden Valley Rieslings isn't easy, as they often don't show their full potential for several years. The 2012 Bin 51 is tight and linear, crisply focused and a bit one-dimensional at this age. But the lime-driven fruit is potent and the finish beautifully clean and long. It should develop well over the next 7\u20138 years or more.","38276":"This medium-bodied Chardonnay is plump without being heavy, featuring modest citrus aromas but greater depth of fruit on the palate, adding pear and melon flavors to the mix. It's fresh and lively on the finish, which should serve it well with a wide variety of dishes. Drink now\u20132013.","38309":"This is surprisingly plump and accessible, featuring scents of lime rind upfront, then flavors of apple, nectarine and citrus. A medium-bodied wine with a long, mouthwatering finish, it's a tasty near-term drinker but should develop well for up to 10 years.","38314":"This GSM blend includes bits of Carignan and Cinsault. It's a full-bodied, supple wine intended for youthful consumption, with a long, mouthwatering finish. Raspberry and cherry fruit is balanced by savory notes of earth and mocha. Drink now\u20132016.","38638":"A big, burly, concentrated Grenache, Yangarra's High Sands bottling seems capable of evolving nicely over the next 3\u20135 years, although it is supple enough to drink now. Black cherry preserves gain structure on the finish in the form of finely dusty tannins.","38643":"A remarkable value, Oxford Landing's GSM is a convincing argument in favor of blending. It offers a complex m\u00e9lange of leather, spice and cherry notes, medium body and a fresh, vivacious finish. Considering it can probably be found for around $80 per case, this would make a great everyday wine for drinking over the next year or so.","38651":"A soft, cuddly Grenache-based (55%) blend, Schild's GMS features red berry fruit with modest touches of cocoa and leather. It's very supple and round, easy to drink on its own. Probably best now and over the next year or so.","38989":"Fruit from 900 of some of the planet's oldest vines goes into this wine, which gives it an interesting link to the past as well as being excellent. Cedary notes frame blueberry and blackberry fruit, picking up nuances of menthol, hickory smoke and mocha along the way. The supple tannins seem to gain grip as you sip, finishing firm enough to suggest cellaring up to 15 years.","39002":"This is a McLaren Vale classic, produced from vines planted in 1892. It's a full-bodied, chewy style that marries cedar and mint to deep, plummy fruit. Like many of the big-name Australian Shirazes, this doesn't require cellaring, but will reward it, at least through 2020.","39029":"Penfolds Bin 707 has leapt in quality over the past few vintages. The 2009 features hints of mint, cedar and vanilla accenting ripe cassis fruit. It's full bodied and rich, velvety without being overly soft, with a dusty tannic structure that should support it over two decades or more of aging. Drink 2015\u20132030+.","39097":"The Taylor family selected Clare Valley for its Cabernet affinity, but this Shiraz is a knockout. Yes, it's oaky\u2014full of menthol, vanilla and toasted coconut\u2014but there's just enough black cherry and plum fruit to support the wood. It's a plush, full-bodied wine with immense appeal, for drinking now\u20132025.","39124":"Deep brown in color, this is a full-bodied, supersweet, thickly textured wine. Scents of rancio and maple sugar waft from the glass, while the flavors are brighter and fresher than expected, adding hints of citrus to the dark molasses and mocha notes.","39133":"This manages to be plush and rich in texture while keeping the alcohol level reined in. Pineapple cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e aromas are backed up on the palate by flavors of peach and pineapple, finishing long and rich. Drink now.","39142":"Recently, Angove's various Warboys Vineyard bottlings have been consistently excellent; the 2014 blends 57% Shiraz and 43% Grenache to good effect. It's full bodied, creamy and supple, combining vanilla notes with hints of mint and an ample dose of cherry-berry fruit. Drink now through 2022.","39232":"This is ripe, fruit-driven Shiraz with ample weight and ripeness. Hints of smoke and sage add nuance to the blueberry and black cherry fruit, while coarse-grained tannins provide adequate structure and grip. Drink now\u20132022.","39375":"Combine masses of American oak with high ripeness and the result is this warm woody wine oozing with vanilla, molasses and cedar. It's full and plush, but lacks complexity and cellaring potential. Drink it now.","39432":"This is an earthy, savory style of Shiraz, with modest berry and plum fruit wrapped into a blanket of firm but silky tannins. Ample length and structure separates this from the rest of the pack.","39586":"Full bodied, lush and slightly liquorous in style, the 2008 Footbolt is also packed with peppery, slightly herbal blackberry fruit. There's also a hint of menthol. Drink it over the next 12 months.","39660":"This wine is rather developed, showing leather, earth and tobacco on the nose. Savory and meaty rather than fruity, it is full-bodied and pleasantly supple. Drink now\u20132020.","39688":"A big, rich Pinot, but one that for all its weight and intensity doesn't lack for elegance. Black cherry fruit and spice notes coat the mouth, lingering on the finish. Drink it now and over the next several years. Imported by Epic Wines.","39716":"This is full bodied yet firmly structured, built to enjoy now or age through at least 2025. Ample cedary oak notes frame blueberry fruit and peppery spice. This is tight but still enjoyable, ending in a lengthy crescendo of dusty tannins.","39724":"Cowaramup is a Margaret River subregion. A herbal note adds interest to the aromas, and some lifted red fruit sets this wine apart from Cherubino's other 2010 Cabernets. Otherwise, it's pretty similar in its lavish oaking and meaty, savory flavors, but with a bright, mouthwatering finish. Drink now\u20132020.","39845":"Broad in the mouth and on the sweet side, this Chardonnay-Pinot Noir blend does offer some attractive gingery notes on the nose, while the flavors favor baked apples.","40005":"Modest cherry and strawberry notes appear on the nose and the palate, with some slightly herbal flavors as well. It's light in body, with soft acids and a relatively quick finish.","40009":"De Bortoli's unique approach to harvest timing and extensive use of new oak leaves this wine seeming rather disjointed: coffee and cola notes dominate the tart, cranberryish fruit flavors. I suspect it will show better with a few years' of cellaring, but until then, I remain unconvinced.","40059":"This medium-bodied wine offers an elegant, silky mouthfeel. Some yeasty-dough aromas add interest to the pineapple and tangerine flavors, which linger delicately on the finish.","40185":"Well oaked, showing plenty of espresso-like char and brown sugar on the nose, this is a full-bodied, creamy-textured Cabernet. Mocha and caramel flavors continue the theme, backed by just enough cassis fruit. Drink now\u20132025.","40190":"This 50-50 blend is firm, focused and rich, offering attractive aromas of mint, vanilla, cedar and red-skinned plums. Flavors turn darker, suggesting espresso and chocolate, but enlivened by bright acids. A wine worth holding a few years, priced at $20? Buy now, drink after 2020.","40199":"This blend of two-thirds Sauvignon Blanc and one-third Semillon gets a touch of barrel aging, reflected in its silky texture more than any overt aromas or flavors. The palate is fruit-forward, offering hints of citrus, underripe nectarine, wet stone and green apple, finishing long and mouthwatering.","40232":"Looking for a medium-bodied Chardonnay with a citrusy edge? Look no further. Peach and lime scents ease into tropical fruit while retaining that zestiness on the finish. Drink now.","40257":"A joint venture with Champagne Devaux, the Yarrabank Cuv\u00e9e is a crisp sparkling wine that combines flavors of fresh greens and citrus in a medium-bodied, slightly creamy format. Very clean and fresh, if somewhat simple.","40258":"Light and fresh, this 100% Chardonnay sparkler features slightly gingery, briny, biscuity aromas and crisp, balanced finish. At the price, the only serious competition is Cava, with its decidedly different flavors.","40271":"This is a medium-bodied, somewhat chunky Pinot Noir, but does manage to combine plummy aromas with distinctively Pinot-like sous-bois character. The flavors turn tart and savory, ending on a pomegranate note.","40285":"Parts of Clare Valley are ideal for Cabernet Sauvignon, illustrated by this reasonably priced bottling. Mint and cassis show remarkable purity on the nose, while the palate is properly restrained without being hard or austere. That said, there are some dusty tannins on the finish, so drink 2020\u20132030.","40294":"Although sourced from the warm northern end of Barossa, the intention is to make a less bombastic expression of Shiraz, with only 14% new French oak. Mulberry fruit still comes through, accented by hints of coffee, mint and dark chocolate, without too much extraction or tannin. Drink now\u20132025.","40295":"Despite coming from a warm, inland region, this shows admirable freshness. Cassis, vanilla, some red-fruit tones and baking spices all come together harmoniously on the medium-bodied palate. It's restrained yet intense, with a long, silky finish. Drink now\u20132025.","40297":"This is a terrific value in balanced, ready-to-drink Australian Cabernet. It brings several Bordeaux-ish qualities to the table\u2014medium body, silky tannins and aromas reminiscent of cigar box and Ribena\u2014then adds varietally true flavors and a long finish. Drink now\u20132025.","40298":"Made in a savory, ageworthy style, the 2013 Covenant features aromas of tar, espresso and black olive. It adds intriguing red-berry notes on the full-bodied palate, along with dusty tannins that persist through the long finish. Drink 2018\u20132025.","40495":"This blend of 45% Grenache, 28% Shiraz and 27% Mourv\u00e8dre does show a trace of heat in its finish, but is otherwise a pleasant, medium-bodied sipper at a realistic price. Tart, slightly minty cherries feature undercurrents of chocolate and coffee, turning crisp and lemony on the finish. Drink now.","40552":"This wine's bright berry notes make it very accessible\u2014the raspberry perfume is virtually irresistible. Those berries are capably framed by cedary elements, but on the palate, the structure of the wine is taut, wiry and crisp. Drink it over the next few years for its fruity appeal.","40643":"This seems a bit oaky on the nose, where scents of baking spices and cedar dominate, but those elements are balanced out on the palate, where blackberries, plums and black currants comes to the fore. This is a full-bodied, ripe-textured wine worth a look. Drink now\u20132025.","40646":"This wine ticks all the boxes, but just lacks the excitement and drama to take it to the next level. Smoke and vanilla notes add interest to the juicy, easy-to-drink cassis fruit. There's ample but not too much weight on the palate. Supple tannins. Perhaps it just needs additional cellaring time to warrant the price, although it doesn't come across as needing it in the structural sense.","40695":"The De Bortoli family does a solid job with Chardonnay\u2014even this entry-level wine shows some complexity and finesse. Hints of smoke and graphite frame bright pineapple and lime flavors, delivered without excessive weight or richness.","40787":"A tiny bottling (220 cases) of old-vine Grenache, this wine features lovely aromas of cinnamon, clove and ripe cherries. In the mouth it's surprisingly elegant, delivering cherry and spice flavors without excessive weight, ending on a slightly tart note. Drink now and over the next 4\u20135 years.","41020":"This medium- to full-bodied Shiraz starts off with aromas that suggest cured meats and slightly stewed plums, while the flavors are even meatier, picking up some citrusy notes. Crisp acids accentuate some drying tannins on the finish, giving this wine a somewhat stern demeanor. Imported by McWilliam's of Coonawarra.","41242":"This is nominally a step up from De Bortoli's dB Selection Petite Sirah, but this fresh, directly fruity wine doesn't seem to offer much beyond jammy fruit. It's medium-bodied, with a crisp finish and just a hint of tannic structure. Drink now\u20132012.","41487":"Cut grass and grapefruit rind aromas are followed by simple, crisp, citrusy flavors. It's medium in body, with a slightly chalky feel and a clean, refreshing finish.","41515":"This big, rugged 60-40 blend may dry out if cellared too long, so drink it young with rare beef to help tame the substantial tannins. Smoke, dried-herb and black-currant flavors should mesh nicely with your next roast. \u2014J.C.","41522":"At two-thirds Grenache and one-third Mourv\u00e8dre, this wine comes across full and rich, and a trifle alcoholic. The overall sensation is of a cherry-vanilla sundae smothered in toffee and chocolate\u2014too much of a good thing for some tasters, heaven in a glass to others. \u2014J.C.","41529":"Tahbilk's Marsanne is always difficult to evaluate young, as it's invariably rather neutral in aroma and flavor. Subtle notes of pear and marshmallow make a fleeting appearance before yielding to crisp, lemony finish. Drink now with oysters, or hold 5\u201310 years for greater weight, texture and versatility with food.","41558":"From a warm, inland region, this is nevertheless a fine value. It's rich and full-bodied without being over the top, offering spice-accented notes of peach, apricot and pineapple. Drink now.","41599":"Cinnamon, clove and cashew notes combine with peach and pineapple to offer a fleshy mouthful of satisfying flavor that only lacks a bit of zest on the finish. Drink now.","41616":"This medium-bodied wine balances pineapple fruit with bright acids and mid-range alcohol. It's a simple, citrusy quaff that finishes crisp and clean. Drink now.","41785":"On top of being made from organically grown grapes, this wine is vegan friendly. Of course, that means nothing unless the wine is good. Thankfully, this wine is excellent. Apricot, honey and ginger notes mingle easily on the palate. Drink this full-bodied, slightly open-knit wine over through 2017.","41799":"At 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a firm, cassis-scented wine, but one that includes hints of ripeness and generous fruit. Dried herbs and brown sugar add nuance, while the velvety finish picks up some meaty, savory notes. Drink now\u20132025.","41808":"This medium-bodied Shiraz represents a solid value. Sourced from 80 growers, it's meant to present a \u201cportrait\u201d of the Barossa region, and it delivers vanilla, plum and black olive aromas and flavors, supple tannins and a lingering mocha finish.","42961":"Despite ample alcohol levels and soft tannins, this wine comes across as tart and crisp on the palate, its cola, cherry and vanilla flavors ending on a lemony note.","42982":"With only 10% Shiraz, this wine shows off the exuberant fruit and supple tannins of Grenache. Blackberry and raspberry fruit is mildly tart, spiced with a dusting of cinnamon and cocoa. Good length on the finish marks this casual sipper with a touch of extra quality. Drink now\u20132010.","43088":"This is a potent, rich Shiraz. It's full bodied and thickly textured, with aromas and flavors of mocha, asphalt and plum. The overall impression is somewhat chunky and inelegant but undeniably concentrated. Give it five years or so to smooth out some of the rough edges.","43092":"This wine starts off with notes of blackberry, mint and asphalt on the nose, unfurling on the tongue to reveal tar, black olive, meat and blackberry flavors. It's full bodied and intense, even a bit warm on the finish. Impressively concentrated, but slightly bitter as well.","43223":"Brian Croser's efforts with Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay have finally paid off in a big way. This is a plump, amply textured wine that doesn't lack for elegance, marrying scents and flavors of toasted grain with white peaches and hazelnuts. Long and intense on the finish, echoing with toasty oak but also layers of vibrant fruit. Drink now\u20132015.","43394":"The d'Arenberg style favors structure over plushness, even in Grenache. This is crisp and firm, its cranberryish fruit tinged with hints of raspberry, orange zest, cinnamon and clove. Give it a few years to soften. Drink 2020\u20132030.","43407":"Simple, sweet-tasting and slightly candied, this bouncy drink is best served slightly chilled. Think of it as an introduction to wine\u2014something to explore after white Zinfandel. \u2014J.C.","43417":"If there's nothing special to recommend here, there's also nothing awry. Leather and earth join modest tart berry flavors. Finishes dry and tough; it's an austere wine that probably needs food to come alive. \u2014J.C.","43420":"Smells dry and dusty, like a midwestern country lane in August. The fruit comes through in the mouth, filling it with bright red berries and cherries, while touches of ground black pepper and vanilla oak show up on the finish. \u2014J.C.","43424":"This is a bigger, more forceful wine than its Lindemans stablemate, but not quite as charming. The flavors are earthy and dark, featuring hints of cola and root beer. Finishes with drying tannins. \u2014J.C.","43443":"This wine, which comes from thin, granitic soils, is lean, taut and dry. Hints of lime blossom and green apple on the nose and palate give it a springtime feel, while the finish is crisp and refreshing.","43639":"This will likely prove a bit too vegetal for some, as the aromas hint at asparagus. But there's pineapple and honey on the palate and decent weight in the mouth.","43802":"JC is making an effort to upgrade its Reserve range, and this is a good example, offering peach and pineapple flavors framed by vanilla, butter and toast. It's all barrel-fermented, impressive at this production level (25,000 cases) and price point.","43813":"There's a touch of wood to this wine, but the primary emphasis is on citrusy, pineapple-scented fruit. Apple flavors provide roundness, while the wine finishes citrusy and fresh without being sharp.","44083":"Rich and intense but also round and soft. A horsey note adds complexity and rusticity to the dark chocolate, leather and black cherry aromas and flavors. \u2014J.C.","44086":"This is a thick, ripe Aussie red in which you can stand up a fork. The bold blackberry, vanilla, black pepper and dark earth flavors are not about finesse or elegance; this is stick-to-your-ribs stuff. Best Buy. \u2014J.C.","44568":"This blends fruit from two vineyards, one 80-plus years old, the other 120-plus, then adds ample oak. Cedar, vanilla and plum lead the way, with brighter notes of raspberry emerging with time in the glass. It's not overly extracted or tannic, with a slight creaminess to the texture and an admirably long, supple finish. Drink now\u20132025.","44569":"This is a supple, creamy-textured Shiraz to enjoy through 2020. Red-fruit notes of strawberry and raspberry marry easily with dark hints of plum and mocha, then linger gently on the finish.","44851":"You might not know it from the name, but this is a bit of a critter wine, as Bulldozer is a nickname for the hairy-nosed wombat. In any event, it's a step up from much of the competition, offering sturdy cassis flavors tinged with pepper and herbs and a clean, mouthwatering finish. Imported by MHW, Ltd.","45055":"A tip of the cap to the Angove family for turning out such an ageworthy wine. It's packed and stacked with mulberry fruit, lashings of vanilla and just a hint of mint. Full-bodied and tannic, it should drink well from 2020\u20132030.","45099":"Always difficult to evaluate young, Steingarten Rieslings typically take several years to even begin opening up and revealing their true charms. This one is bone-dry and medium-bodied, offering austere mineral and lime aromas and flavors. Cellaring through 2015 will undoubtedly be rewarded, and perhaps this rating will appear stingy at that time.","45194":"A simple, fruity quaffer, this is almost confected in its rush of red currants and cherries, yet stays balanced thanks to crisp acidity and a clean, fresh finish. Drink it over the next year or two.","45306":"Penley's Reserve Cabernet sees 100% new French oak, but handles it well, blending coffee and brown sugar elements with fruitier notes of plum and a hint of mint. It's full-bodied and lushly textured, with smoky, cedary oak wrapped around a core of dark fruit. Drink now\u20132016.","45382":"Paler than typical for Australian ros\u00e9s, this is more in the style of southern France. It's light to medium in weight, with a crisp, refreshing feel and bright berry and lime zest flavors. Drink now.","45452":"The 2008 Liandra comes across as slightly more savory than the other Clarendon Hills bottlings, displaying pungent notes of coffee, black olives, scorched earth and cracked pepper. The tannins are supple, giving this medium- to full-bodied wine an easy-drinking smoothness. Drink now\u20132020.","45490":"After 21 months in 50% new French oak and a few years in bottle, this Shiraz (it contains traces of Mataro, Viognier and Marsanne) is dominated on the nose by graham crackers and vanilla. The fruit surges forward on the palate, bringing plummy, meaty flavors to the fore. This is fuller bodied than most Yarra Valley Shirazes, with a plush mouthfeel and a long, warm, spicy finish.","45494":"This is a dry, fairly full-bodied Riesling that's approachable now, but should hold well through at least 2024. It's fairly dark in hue for a young white wine, with smoky notes of grilled toast, honey and citrus that linger on the lip-smacking finish.","45496":"The Art Series' little brother is all grown up and ready to stand on its own as a terrific wine. Toasted hazelnuts accent bold pineapple and ripe citrus flavors in this full-bodied, slightly creamy bottling. It's complete and complex, with a long, zesty finish. Drink now\u20132020.","45688":"Imported by Lion Nathan USA.","45748":"Pretty aromas of blueberries and raspberries adorn the nose, leading into a palate of mixed berries and chocolate. This wine, which is in the medium- to full-bodied category, has a silky mouthfeel, ending in a fine dusting of cocoa powder.","45775":"This medium-bodied Shiraz isn't as dark or concentrated as many of its brethren, but it still makes for an enjoyable drink. Cracked pepper notes take the lead, followed by modest red-berry fruit and a crisp finish.","45840":"The 2007 Astralis impresses for its combination of power and nuance. It's dark and almost tarry in concentration, but floral and bright at the same time. Layers of dark coffee and earth are balanced by red fruit, and although it's full bodied and rich in texture, the finish introduces delicately herbal, tea-like notes. Best from 2014\u20132025.","45963":"Concentrated and intense, this wine features a potent whack of oak on the nose, with dark fruit and mocha overtones. There are enough hints of bright, raspberry-tinged fruit to warrant optimism about its aging trajectory, but at the moment it is dark, heavy and slightly scorched. Try after 2017.","46066":"Tempranillo could be an interesting variety in South Australia going forward. This ros\u00e9 features hints of sous bois and cherries on the nose, then adds melon and spice notes on the palate. It's plump in the mouth, then finishes on a dry, silky note.","46237":"There is 8g\/L of residual sugar, so some tasters might object to a hint of sweetness, but others will just find it helps to accentuate the wine's fruit-forward nature. Pear and fig flavors pick up some honeyed stone fruit notes on the palate but this is nicely balanced and easy to drink.","46246":"A creamy-textured, medium-bodied wine, this entry-level offering from Hungerford Hill offers scents of coffee and mixed spices alongside earthier notes. Blackberry and pepper flavors fade slowly on the finish, revealing slightly dusty tannins\u2014just enough to cut through the fat of a juicy hamburger.","46423":"Features an impresive array of tropical fruit aromas and flavors, all delivered in a soft, round, mouthfilling style. It's easy to drink and easy to like. Imported by International Cellars.","46469":"This richly textured Coonawarra Cabernet displays typical notes of cassis, accented by ample cedar and mocha shadings. It's fairly full bodied, with a long, velvety finish; drink it over the next 4\u20135 years.","46481":"A charmingly complex medium-weight red, with raspberry fruit, peppery spice and dark chocolate notes all coated in a soft, fine dusting of tannins. Drink now\u20132014.","46620":"A medium-bodied red blend that will go with just about anything a weeknight meat-based dinner might entail, this wine offers hints of smoke and charred wood to go with plummy fruit and a tart, tangy finish. Drink now.","46624":"This full-bodied, creamy-textured Shiraz from the Lyndoch subregion of the Barossa starts off with vanilla, raspberries and a dusting of confectioner's sugar, but turns darker and more savory with air, adding dark berry and hickory notes. The long finish is richly textured, yet simultaneously marked by crisp acids.","46637":"Herbal, peppery and high-toned, with hairspray notes that detract from the ample blackberry and plum flavors. Disappointing.","46763":"Impressively silky for the price, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (53%), Shiraz (35%), Petit Verdot (7%) and Malbec (5%) is a bargain that should be easy enough to find, with 10,000 cases imported. Toasty oak and vanilla notes frame mixed berries and olives, marrying sweet and savory elements into a pleasing, medium-bodied red for early consumption.","46806":"Hews closely to the Dutschke style: Full and soft, with slightly jammy dark cherry-berry notes accented by cedar and Mexican chocolate. This is a velvety, immediately accessible Shiraz for relatively early drinking, delivered at a remarkably fair price.","46810":"The 2007 Hickinbotham comes across as tight and in need of additional cellaring. Right now, it's showing only some subtle oak and spice framing dark fruit and earthy, savory notes. With its apparent richness and depth, give it until 2015 or so to come around, then drink it over the next 10 years.","46902":"Fresh mint and cracked pepper accent dark plummy fruit on the nose, picking up hints of dark chocolate and black olive on the palate. It's full bodied, creamy in feel and loaded with supple tannins, which make the wine approachable now, but should sustain it through at least 2025.","46914":"Winemaker Virginia Willcock has taken Vasse Felix's top Chardonnay to extraordinary heights this year. Chardonnay yields in the region were down, and this wine reflects an extra level of concentration and power as a result. Grilled peaches and tangerines provide ample flesh, yet the wine remains focused and refreshing through the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now\u20132025.","46939":"This rivals good Champagne in its toasty, buttery-brioche richness, then adds cashew and citrus for an assertive blast of balanced flavor. Drink this fine vintage sparkler over the next 10 years or so.","46947":"A terrific value, this offers a surprising amount of varietal character for the price. Ripe apricot and nectarine elements give a weighty impression on the palate, while grapefruit prolongs the warm, round finish. Drink now.","46958":"This light- to medium-bodied sparkler is a blend of 77% Chardonnay and 23% Pinot Noir. It's from an area not known for bubbles, but makes for a crisp, refreshing drink. Toasty notes blend easily with modest citrus, finishing almost dry.","46961":"More restrained than the slightly fuller 2013, this Semillon is a bit quiet on the nose, but shows toasted hazelnut, white peach and melon notes on the palate. Give it another few month to smooth out the rough patches on the finish, but plan to drink up by the end of 2018.","47228":"Seems prematurely aged, with slight bricking already apparent at the rim and leafy, tomatoey aromas and flavors. Not bad, just old before its time.","47339":"Very true to the variety, with ample servings of cedar, tobacco and cassis, plenty of weight and a firm structure that bodes well for aging. Best from 2010-2020.","47597":"California winemaker Ehren Jordan contributed to the making of this wine in partnership with Australian Bernard Hickin, hence the Two Lands moniker. It's a solid wine for the price, delivering subtle toasted-grain notes, vanilla and citrus custard flavors and a reasonably full, creamy texture. Drink now.","47989":"Starts off rather Rh\u00f4nish, with hints of white pepper and grilled meat, then offers tart cherry fruit on the palate, accented by those same savory elements. The tannins are modest but silky, and the acids turn up while the flavors thin out just a bit on the finish. Drink now\u20132014.","47995":"This blend of Petit Verdot (40%), Grenache (29%), Shiraz (29%) and Mataro (2%) ends up being a pleasing recipe at an even more pleasing price. Mulberry, plum and vanilla flavors emerge from the glass, while the mouthfeel is full and lush. Probably best over the next year or so.","48308":"Jim Barry's Cab program is on a roll, turning out a consistent set of wines from Clare and Coonawarra. Named in honor of the Australian cricket team, The First Eleven boasts a kaledioscopic range of berry fruit, accented by mint and darker notes of coffee, cocoa and cola. It's full-bodied and dense on the palate without being heavy, and finishes long, with impressive intensity and dusty tannins. Drink now\u20132020.","48309":"Perhaps better known for its Chardonnay, Leeuwin also makes an Art Series Cabernet that takes a back seat to no one. The 2002 still boasts youthful scents of fresh mint and cassis, then slowly unfolds on the palate to reveal a rich, full-bodied wine with a distinctly ripe, creamy texture. Long and powerful on the finish, with 10 or so years ahead of it.","48457":"Tempranillo could be an interesting variety in South Australia going forward. This ros\u00e9 features hints of sous bois and cherries on the nose, then adds melon and spice notes on the palate. It's plump in the mouth, then finishes on a dry, silky note.","48497":"On the same quality level as its wooded counterpart, this Chardonnay shows modestly intense aromas, but plenty of pear and melon flavor. Easy to drink.","48499":"Aromas of buttered toast and roasted nuts lead the way, but they're bolstered by ample pineapple and citrus flavors on the palate. Full-bodied, with a soft, easy-drinking finish.","48604":"Tasting young Hunter Semillons is fraught with peril, as often the wines that taste shrillest when young blossom nicely with age. In this case, the wine is five years past the vintage but still seems rather vegetal, showing ample green bell-pepper notes alongside tart citrus flavors.","48666":"As the name suggests, this is a big wine (15.7% alcohol), but in this year the wine handles it well, balancing that weight with bold flavors of blackberry, vanilla, chocolate and cinnamon. Finishes tart and juicy, with coffee and olive shadings.","48830":"The Smith Cullam Riesling is made in a large French oak cask in an off-dry style. The 2012 is higher in alcohol than the 2011, yet also seems sweeter. White peach, petrol and kerosene notes mark the nose and palate, while the finish is simultaneously sweet and tart.","48833":"Sourced from Mount Barker, this is a full-bodied, supple example of WA Shiraz. Concentrated plummy fruit is marked by hints of menthol and peppery spice, then ends in a soft wash of dusty tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink now\u20132020+.","48849":"Impressive for its bold, savory flavors of tapenade and grilled meat, this is full boded and ripe, but lacks the density and concentration of the region's best examples, giving way to an open-knit finish. Drink this over the next several years for its upfront appeal.","49033":"This medium-bodied Cabernet offers a balanced blend of earth and mixed berries. Some dusty tannins are present, but come across as fine in texture, suitably framing the long, crisp finish. Drink now\u20132020.","49358":"Full-bodied and lush in style, with aromas of cherries and spice. On the palate, it delivers waves of fresh fruit and hints of cocoa, but also enough complexity to hold your interest before finishing on a long, mouthwatering note. Drink now\u20132016.","49462":"Features an admirably lean, elegantly fine line of acids from start to finish, off of which hang notes of crushed stone, green apple and lime, with just the merest hints of riper fruit, like nectarine. Crisp and long, this should develop well over the next 5\u201310 years.","49584":"D'Arenberg is better known for its red wines, but this promising effort from the Adelaide Hills is one to watch. Vanilla and custardy notes mark the nose, while the flavors turn toasty and cereal-like, backed by plenty of mixed citrus fruit. It's not overly rich or ripe, but has long, mouthwatering finish.","49590":"The Shaw and Smith M3 Chardonnay continues to be a reliable performer, with the 2007 showing more restrained oak influence than in the past. It's still smoky and toasty upfront, but backed by ample apple and citrus fruit, and on the palate there's more of a toasted-grain note rather than overt vanilla and spice. Acids are crisp, elegantly extending the finish.","49603":"There's nothing subtle about this wine, which layers tropical fruit and pecan aromas over flavors of buttered nuts and citrus. Turns lemony on the finish. The intense flavors are all powered by an undercurrent of gravelly nuttiness.","49608":"At this price, it would be hard for this wine to live up to expectations\u2014which is why we taste blind. But without any preconceptions, this wine was still delicious. The promising oaky aromas of honey drizzled over toast, coconut and vanilla are backed by white peach. It's tightly wound and less giving on the palate.","49615":"A smooth, easy-drinking Chardonnay, with mild, understated aromas of green apple and toast, but also sweet tropical fruit flavors and a ripe pineapple-citrus finish that picks up hints of oranges. Best Buy.","49618":"A big step up from the \u201cregular\u201d Chardonnay, this is riper, richer and longer. Buttered toast and tropical-fruit flavors, a rich, textured mouthfeel and a smooth, easy finish make this a very enjoyable drink.","49619":"Buttered toast and vanilla scents lead the way, buttressed by peach and citrus. It's medium-weight and smooth in the mouth, with a long finish that boasts echoes of orange and lemon.","49625":"This is one tightly wound Shiraz. There's cedar and spice on the nose, but the plum fruit is balled up inside, needing time to emerge. Still, the spice notes are impressive, ranging from sage to peppercorn, and the structure is impeccable. Probably worth trying again in 2016.","49721":"This may be the best vintage of this wine yet. The aromas and flavors are a lovely blend of citrus, stone fruit and roasted cashew, while the mouthfeel is creamy and lush without being soft or flabby. Drink now\u20132017.","49730":"The 2011 vintage wasn't an easy one in South Australia to say the least, which makes this wine all the more admirable. Mouthwatering, peppery, red-currant fruit remains firm and focused from start to finish, ending on a crisp note. Drink now\u20132023.","49739":"This is a concentrated, firmly built example of Grenache, with herbal overtones to its black cherry fruit. Despite the dark plum and cherry fruit, the impression is one of tautness and freshness. Drink it with red meat now, or give it until 2017 to settle down.","49740":"Full bodied and supple, this is one of the more opulent and open of d'Arenberg's array of single-vineyard wines. Notes of vanilla, maple syrup and bramble berries mark the nose, while the flavors add cassis and tobacco elements. It's a pretty, fleshy wine for drinking now\u20132020, although it may age well even past that.","49741":"One of the most muscular of these multiple 2010 d'Arenberg Shiraz bottlings, Tyche's Mustard is full-bodied and burly, packed with dark, earthy notes of loam, black olive, and espresso. Despite its power, the finish is long and elegantly textured. Drink 2016\u20132030.","49823":"Yarra Valley isn't really where you'd expect to find Marsanne, so this entirely barrel-fermented example is a treat. Only 10% new oak is used, just enough to lend a subtle note of toasted hazelnuts to the fruit, imparting silky texture and added complexity to the white peach, fig and melon flavors on the medium-bodied palate. Finishes long and citrusy.","49826":"Dark chocolate and cedar merge easily on the nose of this medium- to full-bodied wine. Those dark, oaky elements are balanced by tart berries on the palate, enhanced by barrel char and oodles of soft tannins on the long finish. Drink now\u20132025.","49852":"Straightforward apple and lime aromatics bust from the glass alongside some slightly smoky, struck-flint notes, but this wine offers rather simple fruit flavors on the palate, It's medium bodied, with a hint of honey already creeping in on the finish, suggesting early consumption is warranted.","49860":"Slightly musky and briny on the nose, with a broad underlay of peach. This medium-bodied Riesling seems lightly honeyed and a little soft relative to its peer group. A user-friendly introduction to Australian Riesling that should be consumed over the next 6\u20139 months.","49913":"This is a full-bodied, well structured Cabernet, with plenty of intense cassis fruit tinged with minty, herbal overtones that give it a slightly medicinal cast. Give it 2-3 years to develop additional complexity, then drink it over the next 7-8 years.","49920":"Peppery-spicy on the nose, adding welcome lift and nuance to earthy notes, plum and cola. the Viognier gives this wine a slightly fatter, rounder mouthfeel and brightens the fruit on the palate, so while the acids are crisp, the wine remains soft and readily accessible.","49933":"This easy-to-drink, medium-bodied red blends 31% Merlot, 28% Shiraz, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Cabernet Franc, then adds lashings of toasty, vanilla-scented oak. The result is a supple wine redolent of plums, vanilla and baking spices that finishes soft and creamy-smooth. Ready to drink now.","50199":"Marked on the nose by scents of berry, rhubarb and leather, this wine morphs on the palate to offer flavors of prune, chocolate and date. Although the tannins are supple, the wine's substantial alcohol (15.8%) shows through on the finish. Probably best consumed in its youth.","50293":"Muscular and slightly austere, this wine does offer attractive notes of mint and blueberry. Some meaty nuances creep in, adding welcome complexity. Although firm, it's approachable now, yet should age well through 2025.","50309":"This is made in an earthy-savory style, offering hints of roasted meat, black olives and espresso. It's also firmly constructed, with firm tannins that suggest a couple of years of cellar time would do it some good. Drink 2018 through 2025.","50485":"Supple and velvety, with a ripe, creamy texture, this shows textbook Cab flavors: cassis, tobacco and some vanilla from new oak. It deftly avoids the common Barossa problem of excessive size and weight, just could use a touch more persistence on the finish. Imported by AUSA Pacific, LLC.","50507":"Despite tipping the scales at more than 15% alcohol, this wine actually comes across as nicely structured and elegant. It's certainly not a fruit bomb, instead offering a complex array of sour plum, espresso, olive and coffee notes to go with its blueberry fruit. It's round without being fat, framed by supple tannins that turn slightly dusty on the finish. Drink now-2016.","50522":"The combination of high alcohol and ripe fruit gives this wine a sweet-seeming profile dominated by plums and blackberries, but there's also a note reminscent of alfalfa or sweet hay. Ripe tannins impart a lush, creamy mouthfeel that extends through the finish.","50628":"At 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, with small amounts of Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, this drinks like a Cab, combining ripe cassis and chocolate notes with hints of mint, brown sugar and cinnamon. It's full-bodied and a bit chewy in texture, which should serve it well through at least 2015.","50633":"Johann's Garden gives consumers a taste of the Henschke mystique at a reasonable price. A blend of 68% Grenache, 17% Mourv\u00e8dre and 15% Shiraz, it offers restrained, elegant aromas of cherry and cassis with a lifted hint of mint, then adds richer notes of coffee and chocolate on the palate. It's full-bodied and creamy in texture, with a lush, mouthwatering finish. Drink now\u20132016.","50635":"This wine's elevated alcohol level (16.2%) gives it plenty of fullness on the palate, and combined with jammy fruit and superripe tannins makes for a slightly sweet palate impression and a creamy texture. It does offer waves of raspberry and blueberry fruit topped by hints of cinnamon and vanilla as well as savory undercurrents of grilled meat and tapenade. Drink now and over the next few years for its exuberant fruit.","51281":"The blend in this torrid vintage is 68% Shiraz, 32% Cabernet, which somehow manages to avoid any sense of baked or raisined fruit. There's a slightly medicinal, eucalyptus note, common in wines from this big gumtree region, but also red currant and cherry fruit, a creamy, supple texture and a long finish dusted with cocoa powder. Drink now\u20132020.","51332":"In 2009 this single vineyard offering includes 11% S\u00e9millon. It has wonderful texture, and a mix of light herbal flavors that run through a gamut from celery to lemongrass and up into tart citrus fruit. The acidity is generous but not searing; it penetrates but never overpowers. A quintessential food wine.","51350":"Hits all the classic well-oaked Cabernet notes: cedar, tobacco, vanilla and cassis upfront, with similar flavors coursing through from start to finish. It's not quite as full bodied as some Australian Cabernets, which isn't a bad thing, finishing with silky yet firm tannins. Drink now\u20132016.","51406":"Lovely dessert-style Riesling at an extremely attractive price. It yields dried apricot aromas, then turns to honeyed marmalade in the mouth, just loaded with orange-apricot preserves. It's weighty and viscous, with a long, sweet finish. Should last through at least 2016.","51493":"This is a smooth-textured, medium- to full-bodied wine loaded with scents of cedar and spice. Red berry fruit emerges on the palate and lingers alongside the cedar notes on the long finish. Drink now\u20132020.","51511":"Despite the relatively high alcohol, this comes across as a fairly classic Coonawarra Cabernet. Mint accents chocolate and cassis, and the wine is full bodied yet still seems a bit restrained on the palate. Firm tannins frame the dusty, appropriately drying finish. Drink 2016\u20132025.","52050":"For under $10, this wine delivers an admirable blend of cherry fruit and savory underpinnings. Hints of asphalt and black olive finish on a mouthwatering note, joined by the suggestion of caramelized fruit. Drink now.","52196":"Compact and sturdy, this robust blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Merlot is relatively simple, yet satisfying. Bold cassis fruit joins with earthy, tobacco notes and hints of vanilla to finish with dry intensity and promising length. Drink 2015\u20132020.","52206":"This wine is already showing hints of evolution in its aromas of kerosene, toast and honey. Developing flavors of apple and citrus marmalade suggest that this dry, medium-bodied Riesling should be at its best now and over the next 5\u20136 years.","52590":"You could do a lot worse at the U.S. Open than to sip a glass of this. Keeping it well-chilled will help rein in the broad, weighty notes of peach and melon and allow hints of peppery spice to emerge on the finish. Drink now.","52869":"This medium-bodied Chardonnay is tightly wound. Scents of grilled pineapple and custard offer glimpses of ripe fruit and richness, held under wraps by intense citrus flavors and a long tart finish. Drink now through 2020.","53284":"Thick and pulpy on the palate, this white is fruity and simple, with pear, melon and citrus aromas and flavors. It's surprisingly heavy for such a low-alcohol (12.7%) wine.","53285":"Tart and zesty, with lime and cranberry aromas and flavors. It's light, clean   and refreshing.","53419":"This medium- to full-bodied red features bright fruit accented by oak. Vanilla strongly marks the nose, yet cherry and raspberry also come through, tinged with baking spices. Crisp and firm on the finish; try pairing with rich cuts of red meat.","53428":"This pale salmon ros\u00e9 is a reliable sparkling wine at a very good price. The latest NV release is toasty on the nose, then offers just faint hints of peach or berry flavors. It's lithe yet creamy on the palate, with a long finish.","53533":"The Adelaide Hills is one of Australia's best sources of high-quality Chardonnay. This is a fine example, marrying toasted grain aromas with peach and citrus flavors and a touch of vanilla. It's soft, lush and promises easy drinking over the next year or two.","53693":"Full, soft and round\u2014and reaonably priced\u2014this Shiraz should be a steakhouse staple. It offers dark flavors of plum and earth, dressed by hints of vanilla, coffee and dark chocolate.","54097":"Young Hunter Valley S\u00e9millon is one of the most perplexing wines to evaluate, and I suspect that in 8\u201310 years' time, my rating will seem overly stingy. Still, this light-bodied wine appears to lack depth, complexity and length, offering just some odd, resiny scents and waxy, citrusy flavors.","54104":"With its ample body and complex touches of chocolate, plum and spice, this is clearly a serious attempt at ros\u00e9, just one that seems a bit tired at this stage of its evolution. Drink up.","54419":"This medium-bodied dry Riesling is pleasingly aromatic, boasting scents of ginger, pear and citrus. Then it's linear and focused on the palate, delivering wet stone and crisp citrus flavors that finish long. Drink now\u20132025.","54432":"This wavers from the classic Australian recipe of dry Riesling to offer something with a touch of residual sugar (13.6 g\/L). Notes of crushed stone, pineapple and lime are buttressed by tart acids, while the sugar helps to balance the finish. A strong candidate to pair with spicy-sweet Asian dishes.","54448":"Lean. Linear. Crisp. Focused. This is textbook dry Riesling, showing lime aromas and flavors tinged with hints of talcum powder and beeswax. Drink it now, or hold up until at least 2023.","54552":"Penfolds' 2009 Yattarna blends fruit from Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia, but remains a lean, taut Chardonnay. Flavors are crisp and citrusy, primarily kumquat, lemon and lime at this young age. Give it several years to see if it comes around.","54643":"Very similar in style and feel to the 2005 offering, Wise's 2006 Single Vineyard Chardonnay is a crisp, nicely structured wine with a preponderance of citrus and toasty oak flavors. Apple and pear notes add just the right amount of fleshiness.","54648":"Richly tropical in nature, with ripe flavors suggesting peaches and mangoes framed by lingering hints of butter and toast. It's a plump, amply endowed version of this wine, but may not be as long lived as some other vintages. Drink now\u20132010.","54739":"Cowaramup is a Margaret River subregion. A herbal note adds interest to the aromas, and some lifted red fruit sets this wine apart from Cherubino's other 2010 Cabernets. Otherwise, it's pretty similar in its lavish oaking and meaty, savory flavors, but with a bright, mouthwatering finish. Drink now\u20132020.","54748":"At nearly 80% Grenache, this is a full-bodied, creamy-textured rendering of the Barossa's classic red trio. Savory, peppery elements add welcome complexity to the nose, while the flavors fold in hints of molasses and plum, then end on a long, supple note. Drink now\u20132017.","54854":"If you're looking for a clean, well made Pinot Noir at an affordable price, you could do a lot worse. Modest cherry and cinnamon flavors ease across the palate on silky tannins and linger elegantly on a slightly dusty finish. Drink now.","55211":"The centerpiece of Phil Sexton's current venture (he previously founded and sold both a brewery and a winery) is this single vineyard, from which he makes a Pinot Noir and this wine. The 2012 Chard is a bold yet elegant wine, filled with grilled pineapple and citrus fruit and framed by hints of toasted nuts, vanilla and graphite.","55241":"This wine starts off a touch rubbery, so give it some air prior to serving if you can. The payoff is a pleasant mix of pear and citrus that's fairly broad on the palate yet balanced, and lengthy, too. This year's blend is 56% Chardonnay, 30% Sauvignon Blanc and 14% Verdelho.","55357":"Medium to full bodied, with nicely supple tannins, Wirra Wirra's Church Block is an attractive wine for near-term consumption. Flavors in this blend of 48% Cabernet, 37% Shiraz and 15% Merlot range from broiled tomato to tart berry, then pick up some dried fruit character with air, finishing with an unusually tart edge.","55391":"This wine's pinkish-coppery hue suggests a bit of skin contact, as does the silky texture on the palate. Hints of gingery spice accent flavors of poached pear, finishing on a dry, dusty note.","55889":"A top value in drink-now Shiraz, Reilly's 2008 Barking Mad shows none of the overripe character that plagued the vintage. It's almost floral on the nose, with an intense cr\u00e8me de framboise character. Raspberry, coffee and chocolate notes marry easily on the palate, and although it's not that concentrated, it is full in the mouth and lushly textured on the finish. Drink now\u20132015.","55909":"With its aromas of smoke and cracked pepper, this shows more Rh\u00f4ne-ish qualities than many of its Barossa brethren. It's also less weighty than most, with an appealingly silky texture that fades just a little too quickly on the finish. Drink now\u20132015.","55949":"A textbook example of Margaret River Cabernet Sauvignon, the 2007 Art Series offers perfumed cassis fruit just tinged with mint and tobacco. There's ample body yet classic Cabernet restraint, so it's not jammy or overdone. The tannins are supple enough to make it enjoyable now, yet sufficient to see it through 2018, at least.","55978":"Fruity in style, offering a bubbly mix of cherries, raspberries and blueberries in a medium-bodied format. It's softly dusty on the otherwise fresh finish.","56071":"This full-bodied Shiraz is bulky and a bit loosely knit. The overtly smoky notes persist on the palate, vying with maple syrup and dark fruit flavors. It's a big, flavorful wine that needs time to come together, so consume over the next few years.","56085":"This blend shows decent weight and texture, along with elegant aromas and flavors of scorched citrus peel and grapefruit. It's long and mouthwatering on the oak-free finish, making it a versatile food companion. The 2012 looks to be even better.","56351":"Roughly two-thirds Shiraz, the 2006 Henry's Seven is a lush, full-bodied blend that combines dark, feral notes of cola and cured meats with brighter red-fruit flavors and an herbal tinge. It's a bit warm on the finish, but that only serves to accentuate its spicy complexity. Drink now\u20132012.","56452":"Katnook's top-of-the-line Cab, the Odyssey, already seems mature, with a touch of brick to its color and some dried fruit flavors. But even if this won't improve further, it's at a lovely spot right now, with a lush, creamy texture, pillowy-soft tannins and wonderful cedar and cigarbox notes. Drink now\u20132010.","56453":"Folks who enjoy herbal complexities in their Cabernet shouldn't pass this wine up. Aromas of roasted peppers, eucalyptus and cassis verge on vegetal, but the flavors are more refined, layering rich chocolaty notes over cassis and hints of green pepper. It's only medium-bodied, but still packs in plenty of intensity, evidenced on the long, silky finish. Drink now\u20132020.","56458":"From a somewhat difficult vintage, Stephen and Prue Henschke have turned out a wonderful Cab. Eucalyptus, tobacco and cherry aromas lead the way, followed by flavors that add a deep undercurrent of cassis. It's a big, thickly textured wine, with a long, berry-inflected finish. Not that tannic, it should nevertheless drink well through at least 2015.","56466":"Howard Park's single-vineyard wines continue to impress for their value and consistency. The 2004 Leston is a richly textured, velvety Cab, marked by earthy, loamy scents and classic cassis, vanilla and tobacco flavors. Drink 2009\u20132015.","56473":"The 2004 is 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot and 100% new French oak. There's plenty of fruit to back up the lavish oak treatment, but this wine needs 3\u20135 years to integrate its cassis fruit with the overlay of vanilla, chocolate and toasted coconut. It seems a bit coarsely textured at first, then smoothes out nicely with air, gaining length on the finish. Drink 2008\u20132015.","56549":"Citrusy and fresh, this low-alcohol (11.5%) blend of 80% S\u00e9millon and 20% Sauvignon Blanc strikes the right chord as an ap\u00e9ritif or fish complement. It's lean, lemony and long, with hints of toast and paraffin adding a modicum of complexity.","56599":"This is a particularly earthy Pinot Noir. Beetroot and mushroom notes are dark and earthy, balanced by bright acids and supple tannins on the palate. The crisp, lean finish shows tremendous focus and length but less generosity. Drink 2018\u20132024.","56844":"Appropriately restrained and even a bit austere, this is a firm, dusty-textured Cabernet. Vanilla, tobacco and cherry notes start things off and extend through the long finish. It offers at least a decade of aging potential at a very reasonable price. Drink 2020\u20132030.","56847":"One of Fowles' best efforts, this wine shows ample vanilla and toast influences from oak, but those elements play a necessary role in supporting and defining the ripe peach and melon fruit. This is medium to full in body, with a soft, pillowy texture and a long finish.","56854":"Full-bodied, lush and supple in the mouth, this blend of 40% Grenache, 38% Shiraz and 22% Mataro is the Australian version of a barbecue wine, bursting with rich, ripe fruit. Chocolate, mocha and plum shadings dominate, ending on a soft, warm note. Drink now\u20132020.","56966":"This inky, embryonic wine deserves to be cellared until at least 2025 and should drink well for at least 25 years after that. It takes its time opening up in the glass to reveal notes of grilled meat, vanilla and plum. In the mouth, it's full bodied and firmly built, with a wall of chewy tannins surrounding a deep ripe core.","56969":"You may have to scour the country to secure some of this (only 14 cases were imported), but this is a treasure worth the search. It's full bodied without seeming overly rich or heavy, framing the lush notes of dark berries, grilled meat, mint and licorice with supple tannins. Spice-driven flavors linger elegantly on the lengthy finish. It's delicious now, but should age gracefully through 2030.","56970":"Thorn Clarke has taken its Shiraz to a new level with this single-vineyard wine, bottled only in exceptional vintages. The 100% new American oak gives this a classic Barossa profile, starting with vanilla, cedar and maple syrup-like notes and flowing seamlessly through ripe blackberry and plum flavors. It's full bodied, lush and creamy in texture, with a long, velvety finish. Drink now\u20132025, possibly beyond.","56972":"Is this the Yin to Grange's Yang? The wines are completely different, yet almost always destined to be discussed together. The 2010 HoG is aromatic and bright, with raspberry and cranberry fruit notes, hints of mint and a pinch of peppery spice. It's full-bodied, but with elegant, supple tannins that ease gently into a long, crisp finish. Drink now\u20132030.","57026":"Made in a mouthfilling, supple style, this cheerful blend is easy to like and easy on the pocketbook. Black cherry and vanilla notes are perhaps a little simple, but carried along by a rich, creamy mouthfeel and a lingering finish, they make for a satisfying glass of hearty red. Drink now-2014.","57217":"Pretty textbook cool-climate Chardonnay here, from the lovely aromas of toasted grain, white peach and pineapple, to the balanced alcohol levels, medium body and vibrant, citrusy finish. Drink now\u20132020.","57382":"The not-so-secret blend is 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Shiraz and 12% Malbec, yielding a dark plummy wine with ample palate weight and softly dusty tannins. Espresso and black olive shadings give this a savory cast, making it more an accompaniment to food than a standalone sipper. Drink now through 2019.","57439":"This is the rarest of all finds: a high-quality Pinot Noir at an everyday price. It's medium bodied and crisp, with ample complexity that blends smoke, cedar, cola and black cherry notes. With its reasonably firm finish, it might be interesting to try in another year or two, although it's ready to drink now.","57553":"Most of this skin-fermented blend of 64% Semillon and 36% Sauvignon Blanc spent four months in new oak. The result is aromatically restrained, but full-bodied and a bit oily in texture. Hints of marmalade and white pepper appear on the palate, lingering through the long, dusty-with-tannins finish.","57744":"This silky-textured, medium-bodied wine starts off with aromas of toasted marshmallow and ripe citrus. The flavors show more range, covering hints of melon, white peach, lime, pineapple and roasted cashew, before finishing long and crisp.","58045":"This medium-bodied shiraz is remarkably fresh and vibrant, deftly blending maple syrup and smoke with red berries, then easing into a firm, dusty finish. Drink now\u20132025.","58049":"Interestingly, I preferred this winery's entry-level Cabernet (Blacksmith) to this one. The 2014 Jackaman is so supple and easy to drink that it lacks a bit of the Cabernet austerity that makes the variety so attractive with red meats. Vanilla, dill and cassis notes finish softly dusty. This is very smooth and polished in texture, maybe too much so for me.","58217":"Loaded with smoke, hickory and vanilla, this definitely shows plenty of oak, but there's also plenty of fruit to balance the ledger. Cola and blackberry flavors pick up a slightly tart edge on the long, finely textured finish.","58224":"The cool Coonawarra region can produce Shiraz with more elegance and complexity than is seen in hot regions, and this is a fine example, balancing ample weight with juicy acidity. Toasty oak frames flavors of cassis and mint, blackberry and spice. Drink this great value from now\u20132020.","58238":"There's nothing to dislike about the 30th anniversary release of this iconic Australian wine\u2014only the price is hard to swallow. Cedar, earth and mint frame the nose, while the dark-fruit and rich cola flavors ease across the palate in a wave of creamy tannins. It even firms up a little on the finish; could age until 2020.","58341":"Smoky and herbal upfront, this is a light-bodied wine with silky-soft tannins. The flavors are on the savory side, ranging from hickory smoke and hung game to dried mint and thyme. Worth trying with roasted or braised lamb.","58379":"This medium-bodied wine is a bit austere and crisp, with cherry fruit accented by hints of mint and beetroot.","58406":"Reasonably complex for such an inexpensive wine, with crunchy red-berry fruit framed by slightly unintegrated timber notes. Without much tannic structure, the alcohol shows a bit of warmth on the finish.","58532":"Matured in 70% new French oak for six months, this is quite different from most Margaret River versions of this blend. It's more like a white Graves, with a silky mouthfeel and ripe, restrained fruit notes of fig and melon that linger on the finish.","58632":"This is the sort of Shiraz that forces tasters to re-examine their view of the variety as produced in Australia. It starts off with powerful aromas of cracked pepper and floral notes evocative of violets, then delivers explosively spicy flavors of pepper and licorice cushioned by ripe blackberries and a rich, supple texture. It's the best of New and Old Worlds. Drink 2010\u20132020 plus. Imported by USA Wine West.","58684":"This blend of 63% Marsanne, 28% Viognier and 9% Roussanne is a warm, broad wine, ably reflecting its grape varieties and geographic origins. It's slightly toasty and honeyed on the nose, then delivers hints of toasted marshmallow and poached pear on the palate.","58730":"Crisp and tightly wound, this is a relatively austere Cabernet with an astringent finish. Cassis emerges with enough airing, accompanied by tart cranberries, which act to accentuate the drying tannins. Try after 2020.","58855":"The blended Pinot Noir from Dalrymple equals (or even exceeds) the single-vineyard bottlings on occasion. The 2012 is sturdy yet elegant, with ample weight joined by a silky texture on the long finish. It smells earthy, yet delivers cola, dark cherry and plum flavors.","58909":"To be fair, the Cabernet Franc portion of this wine is only 3%, so don't expect to be bowled over by Loire-like florals or leafiness. Rather, it's a dense full-bodied wine, savory in style, with edgings of charred meat, grilled plum, mocha and a long cocoa-tinged finish. Drink 2020\u20132030.","58970":"This is surprisingly tough and tannic for a wine that incorporates 8% of a white variety. But those mouth-drying tannins give shape to the cassis, cranberry and black olive notes. Take a chance by cellaring this rather austere wine for five years or so and see how it develops.","58988":"This is a medium-weight, supple Cabernet with bright acids that's seemingly designed for early drinking. Perfumed notes of mint, vanilla, brown sugar and cassis lead the way, followed by similar flavors and ample oak.","59017":"The blend is approximately 50-50 in this full-bodied but firm, slightly closed wine. The cassis, cedar and vanilla aromas and flavors are spot on, so just give it another year or two to soften. Drink 2017\u20132025.","59029":"The cuttings for this vineyard were taken from the Old Garden Vineyard, so despite it's relatively young age, it has pedigree. Sage, smoke and black olive notes mingle easily on the nose, backed by flavors of vanilla, black cherry and mocha. It's medium to full in body and creamy in texture, with a smooth, silky finish.","59279":"This medium-bodied blend of 50% Cabernet and 50% Merlot features decent cassis fruit marked by herbal touches. A hint of raisin is balanced by minty freshness, and the wine finishes a bit short.","59437":"A fairly full-bodied, broad wine, with aromas and flavors of honeyed peach and pineapple. Could use a little length to its finish and complexity to its flavors, but this is a pleasant, easy-drinking style.","59445":"Peach, pear and melon notes on the nose and in the mouth are tinged with some slightly herbal (fennel?) notes, turning tart and citrusy on the finish. It's a pleasant, medium-bodied quaff for the summer months.","59454":"An effusively fruity, unoaked style of Chardonnay, with bold flavors of pear, apple and citrus and maybe even a touch of mango. Its charms are upfront for all to see, as it loses a bit of intensity and lacks length on the finish.","59590":"Like the D&J; Chardonnay, this is a readily approachable, easy-drinking wine with good varietal character. Cassis fruit dominates, accented by slightly herbal notes suggestive of mint. The tannins are supple, adding an appropriately dusty edge to the finish. Drink now\u20132012.","59614":"This is a crisp, tart and somewhat ungenerous example of Australian Pinot Noir. It's lean and wiry, with a solid sinew of pie-cherry fruit, so maybe it just needs time, as it seems otherwise well made.","59716":"Full bodied and rich, with extravagant mint, chocolate, cassis, coffee and cedar notes that come close to going over the top, kept in check by muscular tannins that impart the texture of fine powder to the wine's lengthy finish. Drink 2012\u20132020.","59717":"Sourced from Kilikanoon's home region of Clare, this is a lush, creamy-textured Shiraz of chocolaty richness, balanced by notes of black olive, plum and mocha. It's intense but not overbearing, with lingering notes of dark fruit and spice on the finish. Drink now\u20132020.","59768":"Minty and raisiny on the nose, with Port-like elements of dried fruit and high (15.0%) alcohol. Still, it shows the variety's trademark delicate structure and silky texture.","59836":"Brian Croser's efforts with Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay have finally paid off in a big way. This is a plump, amply textured wine that doesn't lack for elegance, marrying scents and flavors of toasted grain with white peaches and hazelnuts. Long and intense on the finish, echoing with toasty oak but also layers of vibrant fruit. Drink now\u20132015.","59948":"Full-bodied and supple in texture, this plummy Shiraz offers plenty of enjoyment at a realistic price. Vanilla and brown sugar notes frame blueberries and spice, with just a hint of bitterness apparent on the finish. Drink now\u20132012.","59976":"This blend of 54% Grenache, 28% Shiraz and 18% Mourv\u00e8dre often offers solid value. The 2009 features hints of mocha, vanilla and red plum on the nose, accented by a pinch of peppery cinnamon. In the mouth, it's medium to full in body and richly textured without being over the top, then ends on a warming spice note. Drink now and over the next few years.","59992":"This is a top example of the classic Australian blend. Cabernet (57%) provides cigar box aromas and elongates the finish, while Shiraz (43%) fills out the midpalate. The combination is full-bodied yet muscular, generous yet firmly structured. Essence of cassis is framed by hints of vanilla and cedar, while the long finish shows off chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink 2023\u20132035, and posssibly beyond.","59999":"This is a throwback to those brash, flavor-exuding Aussie wines of the past. Flashy, sweet-scented oak (think maple syrup and toasted coconut) marks the nose, while concentrated cassis and vanilla flavors coat the palate. This is big, but gorgeously so, with velvety-rich tannins and a long, plush finish. No, there's nothing subtle about this blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Shiraz, but sometimes subtlety is overrated. Drink now\u20132030.","60051":"A perennial favorite, Leeuwin's 2008 is another success, marrying ample weight and texture with easy elegance. Notes of toasted hazelnuts and grilled tropical fruit mingle into an opulent parfait of flavor that's held together by bright acidity, while a lingering veil of smoke hangs on the finish.","60170":"A lightweight, supple Pinot with decent varietal definition, Salitage's Treehouse Pinot features slightly herbal notes of brown sugar and cherries, then fades quickly on the finish. Drink now.","60283":"A relatively restrained, minerally version of Australian Chardonnay, with a touch of graphite to the crisp pear aromas. Some gently toasted nut notes impart richness of texture and complexity on the palate. Long and slightly tannic on the finish, this could develop well over the next 2\u20133 years.","60291":"Fans of structured Chard should give this a try. Ripe citrus flavors are subtly framed by toasty oak in a medium-bodied wine that finishes crisp and minerally. Good now, but should last through 2010.","60427":"Full-bodied and embued with tannins supple to the point of creaminess, this dark-fruited Shiraz offers flavors of leather, cola, espresso and bits of black olive and tar. Ready to drink.","60531":"This young, fruit-driven sparkling red delivers the party in a bottle. Currants and black cherries abound, accented by touches of cigar box and vanilla, while the palate is ripe and creamy-textured. Drink now.","60566":"Starts with scents of pear and melon, butter and spice, but takes on an ever-larger oak presence in the mouth, adding more and more wood spice and cedar. Not sure if this will ever completely integrate, so the best bet seems to be drinking earlier rather than later.","60643":"This wine displays peppery, spicy, briery fruit sweetness without discernible berry character. It's silky and plump on the palate, making it easy to drink in the near term.","60652":"Earthy and tarry at first, this is a firmly structured Shiraz. Peppery notes accent blueberry and blackberry fruit along the way to a slightly abbreviated finish. Try in 2016.","60771":"Not the darkest, biggest or richest Shiraz to ever come out of Australia, this is nevertheless a delightful wine. A green peppercorn note accents red raspberry and cherry fruit, with just a hint of vanilla in the background. Drink it over the next year or two.","60810":"Broad on the palate and seemingly even a bit warm in alcohol, this lacks the spine and concentration of the Art Series bottling yet still remains a bold, authoritative example of Margaret River Chardonnay. Apple, pear and melon notes all swirl together before finishing in a whirl of smoke. Drink now.","60910":"Shows some of the warmth of the vintage in its elevated alcohol levels and high-toned fruit. It's full-bodied and supple, with flavors of brandied plums and baking spices. Drink it over the next few years.","60915":"This is a classically styled Coonawarra Cab, with ample cassis, cedar and mint wrapped up into a balanced, well-proportioned whole. The Katnook style favors silky tannins over power, making this elegant Cabernet one to drink over the next several years.","60919":"This 60-40 blend combines Shiraz's blackberry fruit with Cab's slightly herbal notes to make a pretty marriage. It shows enough firmness to stand up to rich, fatty meats now, or to sustain it through up to a decade of cellaring.","60971":"A blend of Shiraz from Eden Valley and the valley floor, this is both amply endowed and impressively complex. The creamy pur\u00e9e of raspberries is dusted with peppery spice and cocoa, leaving a savory impression on the lasting finish. Drink now\u20132015.","61036":"Comes across as a bit sweet and soft, with tropical fruit and a lush, creamy texture. Clean and well made, but lacks complexity and length.","61046":"Penfolds' entry-level Chardonnay is a medium-bodied, easy-drinking wine with modest fig and anise notes. Drink up.","61126":"A new wine from the next generation of Barry boys (Tom and Sam), this is a blend of 70% Shiraz and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a bit herbal, but the bright red-fruit notes win out in the end. Hints of raspberries linger through the finish, whose slightly earthy, gritty tannins would pair well with simple grilled meat dishes\u2014burgers, anyone?","61161":"Oatley Wines, based in eastern Australia, sources a few bottlings from out west, like this flagship Cabernet. Cedar, tobacco and cassis mingle easily on the nose and palate, while the texture is supple, turning to silk on the long finish. Drink now\u20132028.","61162":"A terrific value if you can find it (alas, only 150 cases were imported), this is full bodied and richly textured, marrying hints of peppery spice with grilled lavender and rosemary that perfectly season the beach cherry and mocha flavors. It's stout, tannic and mouth coating on the finish, ideal for matching with roasts or steaks. Drink 2018\u20132025.","61405":"This is already showing some evolution in its color, displaying some lightening at its rim. The aromas are floral and tea-like, with subtle cinnamon and spice shadings, and the flavors follow along, resembling Wild Berry Zinger tea. It's medium in weight, with silky tannins and a softly dusty finish.","61474":"The Dead Arm is always firmly structured, making it one of the more challenging Shiraz to judge in its youth. The 2010 is full-bodied and chewy, characterized by dark, earthy and umami notes of roasted meat, asphalt and grilled mushrooms. The length and ripely tannic nature of the finish is reassuring. Drink 2018\u20132030.","61652":"An excellent value, the 2008 Gold Label Shiraz is a full-bodied, powerfully built wine, filled out by cassis, chocolate and tobacco flavors. It's long and velvety on the finish, not just an upfront powerhouse. Drink now\u20132020.","61654":"This ripe Grenache is full-bodied and fruit-driven, but seems to have the stuffing to last at least 3\u20134 years. Cherry-berry flavors are punched up by herb and spice shadings that linger on the finish.","61674":"Herbal and stemmy (100% whole-bunch fermented), this is a bit of an outlier in the world of Australian Pinot Noir. It's light to medium in weight, with gentle tannins and tart cherry fruit. Oak takes the form of mocha on the finish. My initial impression was \u201csimple but appealing,\u201d but upon reflection perhaps it just needs more time to show its stuff.","62058":"You might not know it from this wine's rather austere exterior, but this is actually from a warm site within the cool Yarra Valley. It's a restrained, slightly herbal blend of 62% Cabernet, 27% Merlot and 11% Petit Verdot that finishes with a tough mouthful of tannin. Hold it for another 3\u20134 years and hope that the fruit holds up.","62348":"This full-bodied, almost liquorous rendering of Mourv\u00e8dre is packed with fruit, power and finesse. Aromas of smoke, vanilla and graham crackers frame flavors of jammy blackberries and cassis. These finish with some alcoholic warmth yet remain plush and elegant. Drink now\u20132025.","62386":"Like all of the 2006 Garden offerings from Two Hands, this one is full-bodied, creamy and makes a slightly sweet impression on the palate because of its combination of high alcohol (15.2%) and superripe fruit. Cedary, spicy oak accents raspberry and cassis flavors, which persist on the long finish. Drink now\u20132011.","62524":"Toasty, mealy aromas combine with peach and smoke in a beguiling, complex nose that resembles a fine Chassagne-Montrachet. Flavors of peach and citrus coat the palate without ever seeming overly rich, heavy or oily, extending through the long ripe-citrus finish.","62564":"An icon in Australia, Mount Mary has never made a huge splash here in the States. Perhaps because such miniscule quantities are available (30 cases of the 2005 Quintet). The 2005 Quintet presents as a medium-bodied, nicely rounded Bordeaux-style blend, marrying cedary, meaty notes with cherry fruit and graced with touches of cinnamon and mushroom. It's nicely balanced and reasonably complex; ready to drink now.","62612":"Simple, confected fruit flavors mark this youthfully aggressive blend. There's plenty of intensity, just a lack of focus to its rambunctious fruit.","62811":"D'Arenberg wines are typically quite structured, so this wine's full body and creamy texture come as a bit of a surprise. Earthy, loamy notes run alongside espresso, black olive and blueberry before finishing long and silky. Drink now\u20132020.","62815":"Already showing a touch of bricking at the rim, this tobacco-accented Cabernet is ready to drink. Dried leaf and cedar notes blend easily with red and black currants on the nose and palate, gliding to a smooth, cigar-box finish. It shows more restraint than other Cabernets of the vintage, but still packs in ample weight and power. Drink now\u20132020.","62818":"Despite it's modest reported alcohol level, this is a plush, rounded example of Chardonnay, loaded with fruit. A whiff of woodsmoke frames pineapple and mango, adding complexity while still allowing the tropical notes to shine through. Drink now\u20132017.","63405":"Mint marks the nose of this otherwise darkly attractive wine. Notes of mocha and plum nicely set up the wine, as do the supple tannins, but then there's a jarring edge of prickly acidity that cuts across the palate and disrupts the flow. There are some nice parts here that don't quite come together.","63442":"This is a full-bodied, rich and round Cabernet Sauvignon. Juicy, mouthwatering cassis fruit is framed by cedar, vanilla and baking spices, while the finish showcases fine tannins. Given the quality of this wine, it's a shame that Wynns' high-end john Riddoch Cab doesn't get exported to the U.S.","63452":"This single vineyard wine is full bodied but crisp, with savory notes of roasted meat and campfire more in evidence than bold fruit. It finishes long and a bit tart.","63563":"This is strongly marked by new oak on the nose at this stage, suggesting toast, brown sugar and coffee, but fruit comes through on the palate where hints of dark berries, cola, clove and cinnamon mingle. The wine is creamy and lush in texture, with ample weight and a lingering finish of dried fruit, vanilla and mocha. Drink from 2018 to 2025.","63576":"Tim Knappstein's decision to focus on the Adelaide Hills bears fruit in this terrific-value Pinot Noir. The aromas and flavors are a colorful m\u00e9lange of beets, black cherries and purple heirloom tomatoes, backed by a rich texture and a long velvety finish. Drink now until 2020.","63928":"Fresh berry-salad aromas suggest tart, just-ripe summer fruits in this medium-bodied Shiraz filled with crunchy fruit. It's forward and smashable in the best sense, even if it's not profound.","64026":"Although not indicated on the label, this is 100% Mourv\u00e8dre, bone dry and barrel fermented. As a result, it's not your typical fresh and fruity ros\u00e9, showing instead dark, complex flavors of cola, chocolate tree bark and earth. Hints of strawberry lighten it somewhat, but this is almost more red than ros\u00e9. Drink now\u20132008.","64031":"In a recent lineup of Australian sparklers, Clover Hill's 2003 Brut was a standout, showing convincing toasty, autolytic notes layered over crisp apple and citrus flavors. It's medium-bodied and slightly creamy in texture, with a long, crisp finish.","64042":"This broad, mouthfilling Grenache ros\u00e9 features hints of berries, chocolate and some herbaceous notes. It's more like a light red than a true ros\u00e9, showing considerable weight and body, then finishes dry, with a hint of minerality.","64165":"A step up from the solid 2013, this vintage offers more vivid raspberry fruit and cracked pepper. It's a bit jammy, but then some dried spices emerge on the finish, reining things in and imparting welcome complexity. Drink now\u20132023.","64177":"The Angove family has made a real commitment to its prestige wine portfolio, and this Shiraz represents that new level of quality. It's ripe without being over the top, marrying ripeness and supple tannins with savory notes of tar and espresso. Drink now\u20132025, possibly beyond.","64178":"Smoky, savory and plummy, this wine boasts ample weight and a plush, creamy texture. This rich, concentrated wine finishes with great length and silky tannins.","64181":"Meaty and savory, this is surprisingly full-bodied and supple for a Yarra Valley Syrah. Blackberry and spice notes balance out the meatiness, imparting a bright, mouthwatering juiciness to the long finish.","64276":"This is made in a full-blown style, with ripe peaches married to grilled nuts and plenty of toasty oak. Yet despite all of the fruit and oak intensity, there's crispness and structure as well, giving a sense of balance and elegance to the lingering citrus and cashew finish.","64590":"The blend is 59% Shiraz, 41% Grenache in this medium-bodied, low-tannin red. The aromas are dark\u2014black cherry and plum\u2014but the flavors are redder and juicier, with raspberry notes backed by cinnamon and clove. The label may be a bit polarizing, but the wine inside is well made and a solid value.","64703":"A lean, crisp style of Chardonnay, with citrusy flavors and a touch of honeyed development. Drink it over the next few months.","64705":"A fruit-driven Cabernet, with cheerful, bright cherry-berry flavors. Tannins are firm but ripe, accenting the cassis-tinged close with a slightly dusty texture.","64815":"Despite the presence of Shiraz and Mataro in the blend, this shows some of Grenache's shortcomings in its straightforward, almost confected red berry aromas and flavors. It's a bold mouthful of fruit that's a bit syrupy in texture.","64820":"Known more for its red wines, Wolf Blass nevertheless makes a creditable Chardonnay for $12. hints of vanilla and toasted almond mark the nose, while the fruit flavors veer toward citrus and stay there, turning lemony on the finish.","64829":"Pineapples, pears and citrus fruits fall over each other in this soft, fruit-driven Chardonnay. It's medium in body, with just enough citrus on the finish to keep it together. A solid effort, especially for the price.","64991":"For the price, this is a remarkable achievement. It's a varietally correct, properly lightweight Pinot Noir imbued with attractive black cherry fruit. There's a charred-stave character that adds vanilla and a tinge of mocha as well. Drink now.","65175":"Green beans and grapefruit mark the nose; nectarine, pineapple and beans appear on the palate. At just 12.6% abv, it's reasonably plump and a bit sweet-tasting, making for a slightly disjointed package.","65324":"Unlike many an Australian Shiraz, this one sees only French oak barrels for aging. The result is a dense, blueberry-filled wine, supported by hints of toast and espresso. It's full-bodied but not tiring to drink, thanks to an enlivening burst of black pepper on the finish. Best Buy. \u2014J.C.","65343":"Subtle black-pepper notes add an extra layer of complexity to smoke, earth, plum, blackberry and dried spices. This full-bodied, sturdy wine finishes with firm tannins and some lingering coffee notes. Should improve over the next 2 - 3 years. \u2014J.C.","65448":"This bargain-priced offering boasts cool, restrained Cabernet aromas of cassis and mint, with just a touch of tomato creeping in. It's fairly weighty, with bold flavors of Ribena on the palate and soft tannins on the finish. Drink now.","65486":"Deceptively silky and elegant in texture, so much so that its power is easy to overlook. Cassis and tobacco flavors are typical, framed by touches of brown sugar, while the finish turns a bit lean and herbal, with tea-like tannins. 70% Cab Sauvignon, 25% Cab Franc, 5% Merlot.","65493":"There's plenty of vanillin and cedary oak in this wine, but it's easily balanced by impressive levels of cassis and blackberry fruit. The texture in the mouth is creamy and supple, and the finish is long and vanilla-laden but silky, without any harsh wood tannins. The blend is 89% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec, with bits of Petit Verdot and Merlot.","65510":"The tannins of this refined yet full-bodied Cabernet come across as sinfully silky in texture, giving the wine a sense of softness while still providing structure. Smoke, maple syrup and cassis notes gracefully intertwine on the nose and palate, then end on a long, cedar-laced finish. Drink now\u20132020.","65667":"A blend of 54% Malbec and 46% Petit Verdot, this lithe, medium-bodied wine makes an interesting contrast to Cullen's Mangan Vineyard Merlot-Malbec-Petit Verdot. It's a leaner wine, with modest cherry-berry fruit and ample accents of cinnamon, cedar and vanilla.","65867":"Better known for its red wines, Penfolds has turned out a lovely Bin 51 Riesling in 2007. An alluring nose of orange sherbet and petrol leads into a medium-weight wine that manages to be both broad and mouthcoating and yet long and racy on the finish. May not be a long-lived Riesling by Aussie standards, but it should still drink well over the next 7-10 years.","65938":"Full-bodied and fudge-like, this is a big black chocolaty Shiraz. Hints of cracked pepper and dried fruit run through this rich, thickly textured wine. It's ready to drink now.","66013":"Plump, supple and a joy to drink, this wine features a complex m\u00e9lange of aromas and flavors, ranging from menthol and cracked pepper to mocha and roasted meat, all wrapped around a core of red berries. Drink now\u20132018.","66014":"Crisp and compact, the 2011 Diana Madeline undoubtedly needs at least another couple of years in the cellar. The nose is leafy and herbal, but the flavors show cherry fruit framed by subtle shadings of vanilla. The tannins are firm, imparting a drying sensation to the long finish.","66409":"Lush and oaky, this is a full-bodied mouthful of coffee, chocolate and loam flavors. The fruit is so ripe it presents as chocolate, framed by toasty oak and buttressed by incredibly soft tannins. The softness suggests pairing with roasts or braised meats; drink now\u20132012.","66411":"Even Jim Barry's entry-level Cabernet\u2014The Cover Drive\u2014is a hit. Blending various South Australian sources, it takes jammy blackberry fruit, backs it with darker notes of chocolate and layers atop a briary, herbal component, all working together to ably conceal its 15% alcohol. Drink now\u20132012.","66413":"A dark, earthy take on Cabernet, without the obvious cassis character that often overtakes Australian Cabs. Instead, the aromas and flavors lean toward black olive and tobacco. Tannins are fully ripe and soft, making it easy to drink now, although there's enough tart acidity for balance.","66420":"One of Australia's most expensive and sought-after Cabernet blends, Mount Mary's Quintet has failed to impress more than one American critic. It's an appealing, well-crafted wine that combines leather, cherry and dried herbs in a somewhat lean, crisp style that delivers a long, mineral-and-cedar finish.","66428":"Beyond a hint of stuck flint on the nose, this offers clean, varietally correct aromas and flavors of white nectarine, grapefruit and gooseberry. It's nicely balanced in the middle of the spectrum, offering a harmonious mix of stone fruit and citrus.","66437":"The blend is 71% Marsanne, 20% Viognier and 9% Roussanne. The result is a medium-bodied white that offers straightforward, fruity notes of pear and melon. It's clean and refreshing on the finish, with just a little hint of tannin.","66498":"Renowned winemaking consultant Larry Cherubino lent his deft touch to this reasonably priced offering. It's a very ripe style for Pinot Noir, combining ample weight with plush tannins and superripe dark cherry-berry fruit. Drink now.","66660":"This is straightforward, well-made tank-fermented fizz at a bargain price. Chardonnay and Pinot Noir offer hints of toasted brioche and lemon curd, finishing crisp and clean.","67013":"The 2007 St. Henri remains broodingly dark in both color and flavor profile. Blackberry and plum notes are accented by roasted meat, leather and mocha in this full-bodied, densely packed wine. The tannins are a bit chewy right now, but the finish is long and reveals promising glimmers of fruit that portend well for aging. Drink 2018\u20132025 and beyond.","67023":"The Menzies is Yalumba's top Coonawarra Cabernet, and its quality has improved tremendously over recent vintages. The 2008 is pure and ripe, with great black-cherry and cassis flavors, framed by an elegant vanilla-oak note. It's full bodied and plushly textured without being unstructured, and it should drink well over the next 15 years.","67054":"Crisp and edgy, featuring tart cherry fruit and hints of green peppercorn. It's fairly big in the mouth, but lacks a bit of generosity.","67100":"Just a tiny serving of this dark nectar will last a long time. The malty, porter-ish aromas intrigue, followed by incredibly rich and syrupy flavors accompanied by mouthwatering acids and enormous peristence. Layers of complexity gradually unfold in the glass, revealing hints of honey, caramel and beguiling rancio notes.","67105":"This Muscat is the color of dark coffee, with a greenish inflection at the rim, showing the high average age of the blend. It is incredibly rich and sweet\u2014it pretty much oozes across the palate with intense flavors of molasses and dried dates before finishing long, long, long. A wine you can still taste minutes after spitting or swallowing.","67110":"This is dark, almost black in color at the center, with greening evident at the rim. Syrupy, intense aromas of coffee and dark chocolate make an immediate impact on the nose, followed by syrupy, intense flavors of coffee and molasses. There's mind-boggling concentration here, but just enough acidity to provide a sense of balance. Still, it's hard to imagine drinking more than a couple of ounces of this at a time.","67347":"A rich, savory style of Shiraz, with bold blackberry and black olive flavors that work easily together, framed by vanilla and soft, dusty tannins. Drink it over the next few years.","67472":"This supple medium-bodied Pinot Noir is ready to drink. Predominantly earthy notes of leather and dried spices are harmonious and complex without being overly demanding.","67490":"The ample alcohol in this wine imparts a rich slightly syrupy feel to this wine that's not particularly Pinot-like, but still satisfying. Strawberry and raspberry notes carry a hint of tomato leaf, then finish with crisp acids.","67894":"Despite an overlay of dried apricots and caramel, what is striking about this stickie is its intense essence of lime. The flavors of candied lime and pineapple are bright and fresh, finishing long and balanced, without an excess of sugar.","67903":"An intriguingly savory Shiraz, laden with meaty, leathery aromas and flavors of pepper-cured meat and coffee. It's full-bodied and creamy in texture, with a lushness that persists through the finish. Drink now.","68423":"This wine delivers fruit, fruit and more fruit, at a deliciously affordable price. Bold black-cherry aromas and flavors feature just a tinge of spice, then fade away quickly on the faintly dusty finish. Drink now.","68682":"Austere, tannic and chewy, this Cabernet could use a few years in the cellar. Classic mint and cassis notes are framed by cedar and vanilla, but the fruit comes through on the firm, dusty finish, a sign of positive things to come. Drink 2020\u20132030.","68790":"This top Cabernet bottling from Taylors has been a consistent favorite over the last few vintages, and the 2004 continues the string. It's complex, bringing scents of mint, coffee, cassis and tobacco all to the dance, and matching that complexity with weight and richness. The tannins are a bit astringent right now, so try it from 2010-2020.","69027":"Only slightly less rich than its Beast counterpart, the 2007 Beauty is a full-bodied wine nonetheless. Notes of blackberries, dark chocolate and espresso are framed by supple tannins and end with mouthwatering acidity. Drink now\u20132017.","69159":"Fresh, floral aromas lead the way on this wine, backed by flavors of berries and spice. The moderate alcohol level and balance of sweetness and acidity make this easy to drink.","69519":"Named for the year the vineyard was planted, this is a full-bore Barossa fruit bomb\u2014in a positive way. Waves of lush berry fruit are framed by hints of vanilla and mint in this full-bodied, creamy-textured wine that somehow manages to retain a sense of elegance and proportion.","69614":"This is a concentrated, firmly built example of Grenache, with herbal overtones to its black cherry fruit. Despite the dark plum and cherry fruit, the impression is one of tautness and freshness. Drink it with red meat now, or give it until 2017 to settle down.","69622":"Full bodied and supple, this is one of the more opulent and open of d'Arenberg's array of single-vineyard wines. Notes of vanilla, maple syrup and bramble berries mark the nose, while the flavors add cassis and tobacco elements. It's a pretty, fleshy wine for drinking now\u20132020, although it may age well even past that.","69623":"One of the most muscular of these multiple 2010 d'Arenberg Shiraz bottlings, Tyche's Mustard is full-bodied and burly, packed with dark, earthy notes of loam, black olive, and espresso. Despite its power, the finish is long and elegantly textured. Drink 2016\u20132030.","69654":"Aromas of baking spices and pears lead the way, followed by flavors of pear and pineapple. This medium-bodied wine has a pleasantly toasty-grainy note as well, then finishes crisp and citrusy.","69691":"A tart, hard-edged rendition of Clare Valley Shiraz, from the cool subsection known as Polish Hill better known for its Rieslings. Tart plum and berry flavors are touched with spice, vanilla and traces of hickory smoke and bacon fat. The appealing aromatics are the wine's best facet. Try aging it through 2015 and see if it improves.","69769":"Not as varietally expressive as the 2013, this is nonetheless a solid, well-made white wine. A hint of gingery spice frames yellow plum fruit, which then comes to a dry, dusty close on the finish.","69884":"Aged partly in new American Oak hogsheads and partly in used French Oak barriques, the barrel regime shows in this wine's obvious vanilla and caramel accents to its boysenberry fruit. Supple and creamy in texture before turning crisp on the finish. Drink now.","69885":"Chunky and a bit hard-edged, this Shiraz combines plum and vanilla notes with hints of cocoa and black olive. There's some richenss here, it just needs a few years to emerge. Try 2012-2017.","69888":"A solid effort, the 2007 Chockstone is a balanced, accessible red. There's ample cherry fruit, touches of cedar, vanilla and woodspice and modest tannins. Everything is in proportion, and it should drink well for the next 5-8 years.","69894":"The aromas of this Shiraz are surprisingly dark; they tend toward the blackberry and cola end of the spectrum, while the flavors are more reminiscent of stewed berries with a touch of cinnamon. Medium to full in body, the wine is pleasantly round in the mouth, then turns tart on the finish. Drink now-2015.","69943":"This pleasant, medium-bodied blend of 70% Sauvignon Blanc and 30% Semillon features ample flavors of passion fruit and pink grapefruit. It's not complex, but over the next year or so it will wash down seafood just fine.","69959":"This bargain-priced offering boasts cool, restrained Cabernet aromas of cassis and mint, with just a touch of tomato creeping in. It's fairly weighty, with bold flavors of Ribena on the palate and soft tannins on the finish. Drink now.","70130":"This wine, which comes from thin, granitic soils, is lean, taut and dry. Hints of lime blossom and green apple on the nose and palate give it a springtime feel, while the finish is crisp and refreshing.","70149":"The Adelaide Hills aren't known as a hotspot for Cabernet Sauvignon, but this offering, from a warm site, excels. Cinnamon, clove, cracked pepper and vanilla notes accent dark, meaty fruit. It's full and rich enough to be mistaken as coming from a warmer region, with a long, earthy finish. Drink now\u20132025.","70157":"A great value in ready-to-drink, savory, complex Shiraz, the 2009 Cliff Edge boasts plenty of smoky, bacony notes, which add a Rh\u00f4ne-like edge to the blueberry and plum fruit. Black olives chime in, adding even more savory complexity, while the tannins are silky. Drink now\u20132020.","70256":"The oak in this wine is nicely integrated into the fruit, making it barely detectable amid the bold peach and melon flavors. Full and round in the mouth, then long and citrusy on the finish. Drink now.","70644":"This starts off a little reductive, with tarry, burnt-rubber aromas that are frankly offputting. But a aeration works wonders, and this wine opens up to reveal hints of toasted almonds, melon and citrus, all supported by a crisp finish. Imported by American Wine Distributors.","70652":"This Pinot Grigio from a new producer in the cool Adelaide Hills starts off a little herbal\u2014almost minty\u2014then delivers a full-bodied, weighty palate experience. The flavors are fairly neutral, making it more about flesh and weight than well delineated flavors, but that should help make it more versatile with food. Drink now. Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.","70703":"After 26 months in French oak and additional time in bottle, this is a sumptuously silky Grenache. The complex aromas hint at roasted meat, vanilla and stewed plum, while the flavors follow suit, picking up mocha notes on the long, mouthwatering finish. Ready to drink.","70887":"The 2006 d'Arry's Original offers a welcome combination of dark, earthy complexity with notes of cola, plum and black cherry. It's full in the mouth and expansive on the palate, leading into a long finish redolent of peppery spice. Drink now\u20132012.","70920":"The 2008 Phoenix Cabernet displays amply concentrated notes of cherry, cassis and tobacco. There's plenty of stuffing here, with a long finish that fades slowly away to notes of dried tea leaves.","70921":"A robust blend of sweet and savory, d'Arenberg's 2008 Love Grass Shiraz is full-bodied and round in the mouth, featuring smoky, meaty and blackberry notes and a mouthwatering finish. Drink now\u20132015.","71132":"Produced by the transfer method, with gas levels adjusted and a dosage the results in approximately 14g\/L of sugar, this is a slightly mint and eucalypt-scented sparkler dominated by black cherries and coffee. Ends on a slightly dusty note. Multipe U.S. Importers.","71183":"Featuring a voluptuous nose of stone fruit and citrus framed by roasted nuts and toasty oak, this is a rich, amply endowed Chardonnay with a big personality and bold flavors. Ripe peach notes join with citrus, hazelnuts and toast on the long finish. Drink now.","71302":"This coppery-pink ros\u00e9 shows the same classy toast and citrus notes as Jansz's Premium Cuv\u00e9e, with just a hint of cherry and mushroom to differentiate it. It's medium bodied, with a clean, refreshing finish. Good value.","71310":"Somewhat precariously balanced at 15.7% alcohol, this may not turn out to be the most long-lived Shiraz, but it is delicious for current consumption. The tannins are soft and creamy in texture, while the blueberry and black berry fruit is intensely concentrated, tinged with nuances of vanilla, menthol and chocolate.","71313":"The 2007 Gosling manages to combine savory, spicy complexity with bold fruit, delivering peppery, herbal notes alongside cherry and blueberry flavors. It's mouthfilling, with a creamy texture, yet retains a sense of freshness on the lingering finish. Drink now-2020.","71342":"Pie cherry and rhubarb notes make a bright impression on the nose, followed by tart flavors bundled in a mocha-tinged wrapper. The texture is almost syrupy on the midpalate, but turns dry and dusty on the finish. This is a bit disjointed at this stage, so perhaps it will improve with cellaring. Try after 2018.","71438":"Hope Estate is headquartered near Australia's eastern coast, but this wine comes from a vineyard it owns way out west. It's a well-made, medium- to full-bodied Shiraz, boasting a raspberry flavor that's nicely accented by a dark coffee note and an approachable, open-knit texture. Drink it over the next year or two.","71524":"A solid, well-made Sauvignon Blanc from RockBare that combines aromas of melon rind and underripe nectarine with flavors of stone fruit and citrus, this is a nice wine, albeit not one that solves the mystery of what Austin Powers was missing in The Spy Who Shagged Me.","71588":"No doubt informed by winemaker Daryl Groom's California experience, this is a fine example of Australian Zinfandel, marrying briary berry fruit with subtle herbal notes and hints of vanilla, cinnamon and clove. The tannins are soft, yet the wine remains fresh on the finish. Drink now\u20132013.","71766":"A relatively new brand from Tahbilk, the Old School Red blends 55% Cabernet Sauvignon with 45% Shiraz. The result is a medium- to full-bodied red with a silky texture and flavors reminiscent of cassis, vanilla and baking spices. Drink it over the next several years.","71924":"This is medium to full in body and rounded in the mouth, with loads of yellow plum and ripe pineapple flavors. It's not the most complex wine, but offers a satisfying mouthful of fruit and solid length. Drink now.","71932":"Concentrated and ripe yet crisp and vibrant, this wine blends Clare Valley and Coonawarra Cabernets to good effect. Bay leaf, black cherry and dark chocolate notes abound, while the texture turns slightly grainy on the finish. Drink now\u20132025.","71934":"Pretty black cherry fruit is overwhelmed by the wine's other elements: mint, cedar, vanilla and maple syrup. In case you haven't guessed by now, it's oaky, with some drying, woody tannins on the finish.","72017":"This is ripe, fruit-driven Shiraz with ample weight and ripeness. Hints of smoke and sage add nuance to the blueberry and black cherry fruit, while coarse-grained tannins provide adequate structure and grip. Drink now\u20132022.","72119":"This 57-43 blend piquantly shows off the varietal characters of both grape varieties in its combination of citrus and pepper notes. It's like a collision of lime and jalape\u00f1o, but the wine's modest intensity makes it more of a fender-bender than an ambulance call, and the finish fades a little too quickly.","72223":"Although there is only 5% Cab Franc in the blend, it appears to have quite an impact on this wine's aromas, which are intriguingly perfumed and contain some minty, leafy notes. Flavors also hint at mint with some subtle cedary notes, although the primary fruit is blueberry. Like the 2005 Georgia's Paddock, it's full-bodied and creamy-textured, although this wine adds a slightly more tannic edge to the finish. Drink 2010\u20132020.","72420":"Boldly fruity, this \u201cwine product\u201d\u2014labeled as such because it is only 4.5% alcohol\u2014features loads of strawberry and tangerine character. It's perfumy, soapy and sweet, balanced by frothiness.","72428":"A \u201clayered\u201d blend of five different varieties, this starts off a bit floral and lemony, then develops some earthier notes to go along with the modest citrus flavors. Finishes short. S\u00e9millon (37%), Muscat (20.5%), Gew\u00fcrztraminer (19.5%), Pinot Gris (19%) and Chardonnay (4%).","72429":"Boldly fruity, redolent with cherries and pink grapefruit, this medium-bodied ros\u00e9 does have a slightly candied quality to it, but remains a decent summertime quaff. Serve well chilled to help mute the apparent sweetness.","72431":"Medium in weight, with modest pear and melon aromas and flavors. It's clean and fresh, finishing with a delicate touch of citrus. Drink now.","72542":"A supple, easygoing Pinot Noir, with modest weight in the mouth but assertive notes of cola, earth and cherries. The aromas are slightly perfumed and confected, but the flavors are sturdier and more savory in nature. Drink now.","72569":"An admirable effort, combining lemony citrus notes with hints of pear and quince. It's medium in body, with a long, crisp finish.","72570":"Full bodied and supple, this is a dark wine with ample fruit. Cassis and black cherry notes pick up hints of cola on the finish. Drink now\u20132020.","72592":"Shows greater fruit character and purity than the roasted 2003, with blackberry flavors nicely framed by vanilla oak and meaty, savory notes. Firm on the finish, suggesting an optimum drinking window of 2009\u20132016.","72742":"Tobacco, cassis and vanilla notes bring the aromas and flavors, while the wine's firm structure gives a medium-weight feel and dusty texture. Drink now\u20132025.","72743":"This is a pretty lean, tightly focused wine. Grilled pineapple and citrus notes broaden slightly on the midpalate, then come together again on the crisp, lemony finish. Drink now through the end of 2015.","72745":"Made in an elegant, filigreed style, this wine delivers understated hints of smoke, pear and melon. Given time in the glass, some peach notes emerge. Pleasantly plump on the midpalate, the flavors and textures tighten on the crisp finish.","72755":"This vintage, VF's flagship red is a blend of 77% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Malbec and 7% Petit Verdot. Although it's full-bodied and lush, it's by no means the world's biggest or ripest Cabernet blend. Instead, it's impeccably balanced and gentle, serving up cassis, vanilla and a touch of baking spices in generous swirls that reach a crescendo on the long finish. Drink now\u20132030.","72765":"Similar in style to the previous vintage, this ably marries savory notes of roasted meat and spice with ripe, plummy fruit. All those mouthwatering flavors are wrapped in supple tannins, ending on a plush, velvety note.","72772":"This is a wonderful counterpoint to Vasse Felix's Heytesbury. Where that wine is lush, this is more austere, with restrained, Bordeaux-reminiscent sensibilities. Smoky, grilled elements frame cassis and mint, finishing with classic firm tannins and admirable length. Drink 2023\u20132035, although the back label suggests \u201cup to a further 30 years.\u201d","72927":"This north-facing slope planted to seven clones of Pinot Noir seems to produce better wines every year. The 2013 is medium-bodied yet creamy-textured and lush, with black cherry fruit framed by cedar and vanilla. It's silky and vibrant on the finish, making it a treat to drink already.","73028":"Subtle notes of toasted grain frame citrus and peach fruit in this well-priced offering. It's not the biggest, most robust Chardonnay, but it delivers intensity allied to length, turning lemony on the powerful finish. Drink now\u20132020.","73029":"A solid value, this off-dry Riesling features classic scents of lime sherbet, followed by hints of lime, Granny Smith apple and fresh greens. It's light in body, finishing on a refreshing tart yet sweet note.","73032":"Criterion is a so-called global brand, offering Italian Pinot Grigio, Rioja and Chianti Classico among other benchmarks. This Coonawarra Cabernet is surprisingly good given that background. It offers cherry, cassis and tobacco notes, medium body and silky tannins. Drink it over the next 5\u20138 years.","73053":"This restrained, medium-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon is a solid value. On the nose, cedar, vanilla and cassis elements blend together easily, while brown sugar and vanilla flavors are supported by just enough cassis and black cherry fruit. Drink now\u20132028.","73122":"Smells and tastes heavily oaked, with vanilla, smoke and toast layered over notes of blackberry and chocolate. Still, the texture is nice and the wood\u2014if you like that sort of thing\u2014is tasty. Finishes with a slightly drying edge.  Imported by Pacific Wine Partners.","73167":"Fully mature, this mouthfilling, supple Shiraz shows off Clare's savory side, beginning with beefy notes of bouillon and soy, then adding leather coffee and black olive to the mix. The long finish gracefully blends sweet and savory, then adds a dusting of fine tannins to keep everything in place. Drink now\u20132015.","73171":"A rich, amply endowed Clare Riesling, with potent lime aromas accented by touches of petrol, plenty of flavor intensity and a long finish composed of citrus and spice. Hints of baked apple and petrol suggest it may not be the longest-lived Riesling, but it's delicious now and should be good for another five years or so.","73189":"Another very successful Virgilius, the 2013 comes across as slightly more restrained on the nose, but explodes on the palate with bold flavors of apricot, floral notes and layers of gingery spice. It's a big, rich wine, with a slightly warm but elegant finish. Drink now.","73923":"Picked relatively early\u2014the finished alcohol level is only 11%\u2014this is suprisingly soft and round while remaining light in body: It's a charming sylph. The only quibble is that the lime-like flavors fade relatively quickly on the finish.","73934":"After recently tasting a knockout bottle of the 2005, this was disappointing. Ample cinnamon and mocha notes accent slightly pruny flavors; the tannins are soft, while the acids provide a lemony edge to the finish.","73936":"Smooth, easy-drinking and lushly textured, this Verdelho features peach and grapefruit notes that stay refreshingly clean and crisp on the finish. It should work well as an ap\u00e9ritif or with many fish dishes.","74253":"The Adelaide Hills is one of Australia's best sources of high-quality Chardonnay. This is a fine example, marrying toasted grain aromas with peach and citrus flavors and a touch of vanilla. It's soft, lush and promises easy drinking over the next year or two.","74297":"This ambitious offering from Two Hands is a bit of dissappointment. The bold black cherry fruit seems slightly cooked or raisiny, and there's a grassy, herbal element as well. But it's also nicely concentrated and weighty, with a mouthwatering finish that redeems it.","74881":"Rather subdued in fruit on the nose, showing more vanilla and toast, but this really expands on the palate, delivering great fruit sweetness and nuance in a harmoniously round, supple package. Finishes long, warm and spicy at 15.5% alcohol.","74886":"The 2007 Clarendon is in a more feminine, approachable style than Roman Bratasiuk's other 2007 Grenaches, featuring dried spices, watermelon and cherry aromas and fine\u2014almost delicate\u2014tannins. Cherry-berry flavors finish with hints of cinnamon and clove. Drink now\u20132015.","75148":"This aged for 18 months in new French barriques, and the influence of that is marked. Cedary, gently sawdusty notes and a touch of nail polish are apparent on the nose, while the palate is admirably full bodied and richly textured. The finish is generally velvety, but also shows hints of varnish or paint thinner. Overall, the raw materials are impressive, but the wine comes across as a bit disjointed.","75243":"A curiosity that's definitely worth trying, as aged Marsanne from anywhere other than Hermitage is a rarity. This features some hints of honey and toast on the nose, followed by notes of citrus and almond. It's round and mouthfilling on the palate, but falls away a bit quickly on the finish.","75387":"This voluptuous, fleshy Shiraz seamlessly blends superripe berries with vanilla, coffee and cocoa notes. It's full-bodied, with a creamy texture that persists through the lengthy finish. Between the touch of warmth and ultrasoft tannins, smart consumers will want to drink this over the near term\u2014now through 2015.","75391":"Two Hands' 2007 Gnarly Dudes is a nicely balanced wine, managing to be full bodied and supple in tannins while still coming in under 15% alcohol. Brown sugar and cinnamon shadings accent the main plum and earth elements, all wrapped up in a long, spicy finish. Drink now-2017.","75393":"Oliverhill seems to have hit the mark in 2008 with their Jimmy Section Shiraz, a seamless blend of blueberries and cream dressed up with savory notes of dark earth and dark coffee. Full-bodied and creamy textured, this densely concentrated wine should be at its best now-2020.","75398":"Dark and chocolaty in style, with hints of earth and espresso oozing in. This is a big, heavy, fudge-like Shiraz that comes across as impressive for its concentration if not for any sense of elegance or finesse. Might improve with aging, but might not; a gamble, so drink it over the next couple of years.","75400":"One of the Hunter Valley's top bottlings, Brokenwood's Graveyard Vineyard is still marked by hints of toasty oak at this young stage in its evolution. Vanilla accents lifted sour cherry and cranberry aromas, but on the palate the flavors darken and deepen, trending toward black cherries and plum. Has a nicely balanced, silky texture in the mouth, then a firm, long finish suggesting cellaring. Drink 2012-2025.","75564":"From dry-grown vines planted in 1973, this is classic Yarra Yering Shiraz, boasting hints of cracked pepper, earthy notes of root vegetables and hints of brown-sugar oak. It's medium bodied and crisp, with peppery, plummy, cigarbox flavors and a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now\u20132025.","75570":"Dark berry and plum fruit dominates, but hints of mint, vanilla and cedar add interest. Somewhere between silky and velvety, this full-bodied, richly textured Shiraz finishes long and appears to have the tannic structure to age well, though it's delicious now.","75913":"Starts off slowly, but opens considerably with air\u2014so much so that it's probably worth decanting as you might a bottle of young white Burgundy. It's buttery and full, yet possesses a stony mineral quality that gives it balance. Initial peppery-spicy notes on the finish smooth out the longer it sits in the glass. Editors' Choice.","75930":"This plump, succulent wine is a solid value. Understated toast frames pineapple and melon in this fruit-driven style. Drink this crisp, appealing quaffer now\u20132018.","75936":"Kooyong's entry-level Chardonnay features glimpses of oak in its hints of vanilla, cinnamon and clove, but remains fruit-focused. Vibrant pineapple fruit zips along the palate, ending clean and refreshing.","76384":"Pretty impressive for the price, offering mint and cedar aromas followed by flavors of black cherry. There's also a sturdy core of savory elements, like roasted meat and coffee. The wine is full bodied and velvety in texture, with a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now and over the next few years.","76424":"When the alcohol levels are reined in to appropriate levels, this can be one of Australia's top Shiraz. The 2012 is a stunning example of balance and finesse, combining youthful scents of cassis and toasty oak with floral elements. There's ample weight and texture yet silky elegance at the same time, while already complex notes of orange pekoe and black currant are sure to gain even more with five or 10 years of cellaring. Drink 2020\u20132030.","76748":"This blended red brings in four of the five Bordeaux varieties (61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 27% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot). Some prominent mint notes may limit its appeal, but it's otherwise a classic example of the genre, accenting cassis fruit with hints of vanilla and cedar. Despite the ample alcohol and a bit of warmth, there's also some austerity and firmness to the tannins. Drink 2018\u20132025.","76785":"The ILR Reserve continues to be one of the top Hunter Semillons available in the U.S. The 2007 remains youthful, showing a pretty array of citrus aromas and flavors, medium body and a crisp texture. In another few years, this medium-bodied wine should start to develop nuances of honey and toast. Best after 2017.","76913":"This wine is defined by oak from start to finish, with brown sugar and liquid-smoke notes pervading. Undoubtedly there's some fruit in support, which fills out the wine's frame and adds some firm tannins to the mix, providing for potential longevity. The only question is whether it will hold up in the long term.","76995":"A step up from the winery's entry-level Hazard Hill bottling, the 2008 Omrah Shiraz is another terrific value. It takes plummy fruit and cedary oak, then ups the ante with complex notes of smoked meat and leather while silky tannins line the long finish. Drink now\u20132020.","77038":"Five years after the vintage, this is a fully mature Shiraz that shows off the Clare Valley's trademark acidity. Savory notes of bacon and spice add complexity to plum-like fruit, while the tannins are supple\u2014the structure here is acid-based, not reliant on heavy extraction.","77063":"This has all the size and weight you've come to expect from Australia's most famous wine. Huge fruit and huge oak combine in a full-bodied, richly textured package that delivers waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and intense dark berries yet remains embryonic more than five years after the harvest. That said, the texture isn't quite as tight or as fine as some other vintages\u2014expect this to be early maturing by Grange standards, and best from 2020\u20132040.","77071":"RWT (unromantically derived from \u201cRed Wine Trial\u201d) is 100% Barossa Valley Shiraz, aged in 100% French oak. In some vintages, like this one, the combination is incredibly sumptuous, offering layers of blueberry and blackberry fruit intermingled elegantly with hints of French vanilla. It's long, subtle and complex on the finish\u2014a stunning effort. It's approachable now, but should age well through 2030 or so.","77072":"Winemaker Dave Powell is no longer with Torbreck, but the 2007 RunRig is one of his finest efforts. The complexity is almost overwhelming, as the aromas range from peppery spice and roasted meat to blueberry and tappanade. It's mouth filling and expansive, yet retains fine acids and just the right amount of slightly dusty tannins on the long finish. Approachable now, but capable of lasting at least though 2020.","77077":"This is likely the most ageworthy Shiraz winemaker John Duval has crafted since leaving Penfolds. The oak is subtle, the fruit still tight. It's full bodied but bursting with potential, shown in hints of black cherries and plums, mocha and mint. The finish is long, mouthwatering and softly dusty in texture, making it luscious yet firm. Drink 2018\u20132030.","77079":"The fruit for this offering comes from the Green's and Crowhurst vineyards. This wine brings a a sense of cellarworthiness, from the inky color and dense, impenetrable bouquet to the richly tannic palate and long, plushly textured finish. Right now, it delivers hints of toast and mint, blueberry and plum fruit and savory notes of roasted meat and mocha. Drink 2018\u20132025+.","77081":"With aromas and flavors that range widely from grilled meat, espresso and black olive to dried herbs, cracked pepper and blueberry, this is an enormously complex wine. It's full bodied but balanced by ample acidity, which imparts terrific length to the finish. Drink now\u20132017, possibly longer.","77204":"Despite its modest alcohol level, this bottling speaks of ripe fruit. Lime and bergamot aromas bring a floral element, while the flavors are of tangerine and nectarine. A touch of residual sugar adds roundness to the mouthfeel.","77205":"It's refreshing to see another importer take a chance on Pinot Noir from the Adelaide Hills, a region that can reliably ripen the variety at reasonable crop loads. This is a rounder, more supple style of Pinot than most from Australia, with cola, spice and cherry notes reminiscent of Dr. Pepper, or of some Pinots from California's Russian River Valley. Drink now\u20132020.","77206":"As one might expect from a Rh\u00f4ne-based producer, this is a meaty, earthy rendering of Shiraz. It's only medium bodied, but frames its black olive and spice flavors in dry, dusty tannins. Drink now\u20132020.","77470":"This is the sort of wine that should generate some enthusiasm in America for Australian Grenache. It's full-bodied, but soft and cuddly, an easy-drinking, fruit-and-oak blend with flavors of vanilla and jammy fruit. The only quibble is the relatively fast fade on the finish. Drink now.","77825":"From a remote Western Australia region, this is a fine value. Ripe mulberries and cracked pepper mingle easily on the nose, picking up a hint of mint on the palate. It's medium to full in body, with a supple, creamy texture and a long silky finish.","77832":"A splash of Barbera enlivens this wine, which boasts boysenberry, understated earthy notes and a dash of vanilla. The tannins are firm, suggesting at least 10 years of ageability.","77918":"For an Australian Grenache, this has an invitingly cool, herbal bouquet, hinting at dried flowers and black tea. But it's unapologetically full-bodied and rich on the palate, adding black cherries and dark chocolate to the mix. It's warm, velvety and almost fudge-like on the finish yet not raisiny at all. Drink it over ?the next few years.","78050":"Despite its modest alcohol content, this is a medium-bodied dry wine. Like the wines from some Mosel vineyards, the fruit notes hint at red berries or stone fruit in this vintage, backed by strong citrus flavors. This should age well through at least 2025.","78058":"Sourced from the northern Barossa, the name pays homage to the fact that this is not a stereotypical fruit bomb. Instead, it's a savory, meaty wine featuring hints of cola and raspberry. Fermented with \u201cwild\u201d yeasts in open-top vats and matured largely in used French oak puncheons (500 liters), this is a balanced, medium-bodied red well suited to the dinner table.","78120":"Young Hunter Valley S\u00e9millon is one of the most perplexing wines to evaluate, and I suspect that in 8\u201310 years' time, my rating will seem overly stingy. Still, this light-bodied wine appears to lack depth, complexity and length, offering just some odd, resiny scents and waxy, citrusy flavors.","78182":"Leeuwin's Chardonnay continues to be a standard-bearer for Margaret River and all of Australia. The 2012 Art Series is subtly toasty on the nose, blossoming with time into full-on cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e aromas, while the palate offers creamy-textured notions of tropical fruit and custard. The long finish reverberates with fruit, suggesting plenty of aging potential, up to 10 or 12 years.","78399":"Marked by struck flint and petrol notes on the nose, this medium-bodied wine is the most richly textural of Franklin Estate's three single-vineyard wines. Crushed stone and citrus notes linger through the finish.","78411":"I can't recall a misstep from this reliable producer of Tasmanian sparkling. The latest vintage release is remarkably fresh and zesty, bursting with green apple and citrus, with just hints of toasted brioche. This light- to medium-bodied wine is a blend of 53% Chardonnay and 47% Pinot Noir.","78416":"Cedar, chocolate and cherry are the main players, with hints of alfalfa adding a modicum of complexity. It's full bodied, round and warm, with tannins that seem firmer than many in this price category, making it a good steakhouse red. Drink it now and over the next several years.","78435":"Sure, this wine is full bodied and lush, filled with ripe raspberry fruit, but there is also a sense of underlying structure, and some lovely herb-spice complexities, like rhubarb, cedar, cinnamon, vanilla and cracked pepper. Drink it over the next 2\u20133 years.","78441":"Expansive, round and supple in the mouth, this Shiraz features lush raspberry fruit, framed by vanilla oak. There's a tart edge to the finish, providing a solid sense of balance to the lingering warm, chocolaty notes. Drink now.","78453":"A good value in a more savory Shiraz, Juniper Crossing's 2005 features meaty, peppery\u2014even mushroomy\u2014aromas, while flavors of blackberry and black olive build to a spicy crescendo on the finish. Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.","78458":"This is a full-throttle, rich and moderately dense Shiraz with bold aromas of raspberry and plum. Chocolate notes develop on the palate, adding more complexity. Velvety on the finish, where there's also a touch of alcoholic warmth. Imported by International Vines, Inc.","78459":"This full-bodied Shiraz comes out of the chute a bit tarry and reductive, but opens up to show complex aromas of grilled meat, cola and espresso, with flavors of coffee and black olives. Finishes long, with some dusty tannins, but still may not be the longest-lived vintage. Drink now or cellar through 2015.","78497":"You won't find much varietal character in this blend of Viognier, Riesling, Chardonnay, Verdelho and Semillon, but what you get is a medium-bodied white that should prove versatile at the table. Peach, pear and citrus aromas and flavors are carried by moderate weight and a slightly creamy texture.","78640":"Scents of vanilla and baking spices frame bold raspberry fruit on the nose, while the flavors take a more savory turn, toward mocha and grilled meat. This is full bodied and maybe even a touch warm, but it works, ending long and plush. Drink now\u20132025.","78694":"Classic Cabernet, from its mint and cassis aromas to its ample weight and long, plush finish. This is full and velvety, with hints of cedar and vanilla blending easily into the whole. Approachable now, it should age well through at least 2025.","78717":"According to Hewitson, the Old Garden\u2014source for this wine\u2014was planted in 1853, likely making it the oldest Mourv\u00e8dre in existence. This vintage is bright-fruited, offering notes of strawberry, raspberry and even watermelon, framed by hints of cedar, vanilla and dark chocolate. The tannins are supple, letting crisp acidity drive the long finish.","78751":"This release deserves some sort of award for consistency, year in and year out. The 2011 is light to medium in body and long, zesty and vibrant on the finish. Aromas and flavors of bergamot, honey (although the wine is completely dry) and toast are classic aged Eden Valley Riesling. Drink now\u20132030.","78758":"An outstanding effort in a difficult vintage, these old vines (the oldest were planted in 1889) have turned out a super wine. Complex aromas and flavors range from smoke, thyme blossom and licorice to apricots and black cherries. this is medium to full in body, with crisp acids and supple tannins that impart a silky feel to the long finish. Drink now\u20132025.","78975":"This individual and exotic wine boasts aromas of sweet bay leaves, dried apricots and crushed black pepper. The fruit flavors are tart, veering toward red cherries and apple skin, finishing with firm acids and tannins. Drink young with herbed roasts to help bring out the fruit. \u2014J.C.","78977":"The Grenache introduces an interesting stone-fruit influence to this 60-40 blend, something akin to peaches. There's also plenty of smoky, toasty oak, dried spices and chocolate, ending on a liqueur-like note. Full and supple; drink now. \u2014J.C.","79082":"In certain vintages, this wine can be excellent, but in 2008 it's merely good. The fruit\u2014a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (49%), Cabernet Franc (32%) and Merlot (19%)\u2014comes across as slightly pruny or stewed, while the tannins remain firm and leathery.","79088":"This wine starts off a bit tarry or rubbery, but decanting allows the bright berry fruit to come forward. Raspberries are limned with hints of mint and other herbs and framed by vanilla. It's medium-bodied, with a tangy finish and a crisp, satiny texture. Drink now.","79712":"Sweet corn, melon and citrus flavors coat the mouth, leaving a slightly oily impression.","79799":"Yering Station makes a regular Chardonnay and a Reserve Chardonnay as well; this is its entry-level Chard, and quite a good one. Bright pineapple notes and a hint of grilled fruit are clean and fresh if somewhat straightforward in this medium-bodied wine. Drink now.","79968":"From an inland region of Victoria, this is a mature wine. The tannins are plentiful but soft, wrapped around a core of dried cherries and plums. Hints of cedar and brown sugar add the impression of sweetness, while notes of mint and cracked pepper bring freshness.","80179":"This is a traditional, dry Clare Riesling, with a linear, lean profile and crisp acids. Crushed stone accents lemon-lime flavors. Oyster me, please!","80379":"Only slightly less rich than its Beast counterpart, the 2007 Beauty is a full-bodied wine nonetheless. Notes of blackberries, dark chocolate and espresso are framed by supple tannins and end with mouthwatering acidity. Drink now\u20132017.","80387":"Although this starts off showing loads of vanilla and bright, boysenberry-like fruit, this is not a simple fruity concoction; there's some elegance here, and some savory notes of coffee and roasted meat as well. Drink this rich, full-bodied Shiraz over the next few years.","80648":"This is nearly equal parts Shiraz, Mataro and Grenache, full bodied and creamy in texture. Black cherries and peppery spice show up on the nose, while the palate adds brighter red raspberries, bass notes of ripe plums, sweet hints of brown sugar and savory, meaty complexity. Drink now\u20132020.","80649":"Vanilla, cedar and mint notes mark the nose, while this wine boasts just enough fruit on the plate to carry the lavish oak. It's full bodied, creamy and supple, amply concentrated but still very approachable. Drink now\u20132023.","80685":"Complex, rich and weighty, this is a Chardonnay that avoids overt fruitiness in favor of scents of truffle, tobacco and earth, then folds in flavors of honey and spice. Drink now.","80777":"This is an unusually complex Shiraz for the price, ably marrying meaty-savory notes with tart berries and plenty of weight on the palate. Crisp structure, finishes long, with lingering acids. Drink now\u20132018.","80899":"This wine was aged in hogsheads (300 liter) and demi-muids (500 liter). The oak provides a subtle frame, adding hints of pencil shavings and scorched pie crust to the ripe berry flavors. The wine is still big, lush and unmistakably Barossa Valley, showing off raspberries and blueberries to an unusual (and welcome) extent. Supple enough to drink now, it should also age well through at least 2025.","80970":"Hugh Hamilton proves that Yalumba's success with this tricky variety isn't a fluke, offering genuine Viognier expression at a realistic price. Ripe muskmelon and apricot notes leave a round, full-bodied impression on the palate, finishing with musky spice. Drink now.","81081":"As might be expected, this has some familial similarities with the 2004 version (also reviewed this issue). It's full-bodied and dark-fruited, but the acids are brighter and the mouthfeel less luxurious, ending on a crisp note. Give it another year or two in the bottle to see if it develops more lushness.","81092":"Grenache isn't as common in the Clare Valley as it is in Barossa or McLaren Vale, but Reilly's is a consistent source. The 2005 is dense and chocolaty, packed with plum flavors that are on the edge of prune and featuring a touch of warmth on the long, fudge-like finish. Drink now.","81102":"My least favorite of the 2005 CH Grenaches, the Blewitt Springs is still an impressive wine. Dark fruit aromas and flavors of blueberry, blackberry and plum are accented by hints of dried spices and pepper. It's creamy on the midpalate, then firms up on the finish, where a touch of heat is detectable. Drink 2010\u20132018.","81109":"Consistent with the Penfolds style, this is a robust, ageworthy Cabernet that remains varietally distinct. Hints of mint mark the nose and the palate, but the core is cassis, framed by touches of vanilla. Firm tannins on the finish suggest cellaring through at least 2010.","81338":"A big (15.6% alcohol) wine, the 2006 Bella's Garden nevertheless comes across as balanced and drinkable in its youth, marrying a rich, creamy texture with mixed berry fruit and hints of mint and vanilla. Avoids any cooked character, finishing long and fresh. Drink now\u20132015.","81358":"This silky-textured, medium-bodied wine starts off with aromas of toasted marshmallow and ripe citrus. The flavors show more range, covering hints of melon, white peach, lime, pineapple and roasted cashew, before finishing long and crisp.","81421":"A sturdy wine, sporting plenty of roasted cherries and caramel on a medium-weight frame. Turns strongly sour on the finish, where the flavor of charcoal dust also intrudes. \u2014J.C.","81422":"How can a Barossa Shiraz be so green? Its flavors are herbal to the point of being close to cabbage or green bean, with just enough high-toned cherry fruit to be acceptable. \u2014J.C.","81430":"A disappointing effort from this normally reliable winery. There's some dark earth and fruit but it's hard to get at under a veil of charred oak, cellar dirt and alcohol. The finish tastes of coffee grounds. The mouthfeel is fine, the flavors just don't come together. \u2014J.C.","81460":"The small amount of Viognier helps to fill out this wine's mouthfeel, adding weight to the spice-driven flavors of cracked pepper, licorice, coffee and block olive. Finishes long and well structured, with a velvety texture to the tannins.","81807":"Penley's vineyards, towards the warmer north end of Coonawarra, consistently produce noteworthy Shiraz. It's on the big size, at 15% alcohol, but structured, with bushels of mixed berries supported by cinnamon toast, brown sugar and a hint of mintiness. Drink it now and over the next 10 years.","81812":"Made in a very ripe style, this wine's traces of raisiny character detract slightly from its velvety, suede-like texture and ample concentration. It's still admirable for its concentration and richness, but some will find it overripe. Drink now-2015.","81819":"A lush, slightly unstructured but immensely pleasurable mouthful of Shiraz, the 2007 St. Jakobi boasts bright raspberries balanced by lashings of chocolate. Easy to drink, it should put smiles on the faces of Shiraz lovers everywhere. Drink it over the next few years.","81863":"There's a slightly herbal tinge to this blend's flavor profile, but it just adds interest to the otherwise rather jammy notes of cassis, brown sugar and baking spices. This wine is full bodied and ripe on the palate, with a soft finish.","81881":"Yalumba seems to trying more than most producers to rein in high alcohol levels, and the 2014 Y Series Shiraz is a very good effort. There's enough weight to give it substance without seeming overly heavy. Dark chocolate notes frame raspberry and plum fruit, then finish slightly dusty. Drink now\u20132023.","82024":"Dark amber in color, this example of classic Muscat is wonderfully balanced between the freshness of youth and the power and complexity of age. Raisin, malt and Guinness stout-like notes meet vibrant orange-zest and honey characters in a sweet, harmonious whole.","82032":"Coffee-colored, with enticing scents of orange drizzled with dark maple syrup, coffee and raisins. Sweet, upfront and lushly textured, this is an easy-to-appreciate Muscat with great length.","82078":"Matured in used French barriques, this nevertheless shows touches of toast and cedar alongside tart, fruit notes of cranberry and raspberry. It's full bodied and richly tannic, with crisp acids that accentuate the tannins on the finish. Drink 2020\u20132030.","82455":"Matured in used French barriques, this nevertheless shows touches of toast and cedar alongside tart, fruit notes of cranberry and raspberry. It's full bodied and richly tannic, with crisp acids that accentuate the tannins on the finish. Drink 2020\u20132030.","82456":"There's nothing wrong with this wine, which represents a solid first foray into the American market by this family-owned producer. Mint, vanilla and red berries mingle easily on the nose, while the palate offers medium to full body and a creamy texture. Drink now\u20132025.","82517":"This is a full-bodied, plushly textured wine that doesn't quite go over the top. Vanilla and dill notes accent blackberry and plum fruit before finishing firm, crisp and long. This has all the ingredients, it just needs time to come together. Drink 2020\u20132030.","82748":"Probably because of its youth, this wine comes out of the chute a little tight and rubbery; try giving it a quick decanting, or swirl it aggressively in the glass to bring out the underlying cola and blackberry aromas and flavors. Turns slightly dusty on the finish, suggesting at least a few years' worth of drinkability.","82755":"Tri-Centenary refers to the fact that these vines have lived in parts of three centuries, being planted prior to 1901. The 2006 isn't the most profoundly complex of recent vintages, but instead offers remarkably pure essences of cherries and berries, allied to a wonderfully silky texture that makes it awfully easy to drink.","83149":"Solve every steakhouse wine-ordering quandary with this bottle, which features enough structure to stand up to rare beef without any excessive weight. Hints of vanilla and dark chocolate add depth and interest to the red currant fruit, while fine, dusty tannins clean up the finish. Drink now\u20132023.","83155":"Yalumba generally offers fair value up and down its lineup, and this is a good example at the low end. Wet stone and lime aromas mark the nose, while the palate is pleasantly plump without being overly weighty. Pear and melon notes avoid the vegetal side of Sauvignon Blanc entirely. Drink now.","83191":"This hearty Shiraz is no joke. The smoky, meaty nose blends right into bold fruit flavors of blueberries and mulberries. It's full-bodied and creamy-textured, with a plush yet vibrant finish. Drink now\u20132020.","83200":"A terrific example of drink-now pleasure from the Barossa, this Shiraz deftly combines cedar and vanilla notes with dark fruit flavors. It's richly textured, with velvety tannins and crisp acids that frame the long finish. Drink now\u20132020.","83322":"Full bodied, supple and warm, this is a ripe Shiraz loaded with dark plum, cola and earth flavors. The finish turns spicy, with a slightly grainy tannin structure.","83410":"A throwback to the monster Shiraz style of old, with loads of toasty, vanilla-laden oak, meaty nuances and driving, intense boysenberry fruit, the 2004 Grange should prove tremendously long-lived. Its massive concentration and firm tannins suggest cellaring through 2020, after which it should drink well for at least another decade or two.","83532":"Full-bodied, lush and creamy in texture, this Merlot epitomizes the Marquis Philips style. There's a coating of charred oak, superripe fruit and plenty of size without much acid or tannin. Drink this slightly warm (16.5% abv) wine over the next 6\u20139 months.","83665":"High-toned on the nose, coming close to a hint of mail polish, which detracts slightly from the flavors of stewed berries and dark chocolate. It's full-bodied and round, leaving an almost confected impression on the palate.","83860":"Austrian Bert Salomon has turned out a wonderful Grenache-based blend. Potent cherry-berry fruit and ample spice (licorice, mocha and pepper) combine in a plump midpalate and linger on the velvety finish.","83868":"This has gone up in price over the years, but it's still a solid, relatively affordable example of Barossa Valley Shiraz. This is youthful and edgy, with meaty, savory notes accenting mixed berries and a hint of mint. The finish is a bit chewy right now, but mouthcoating and long.","84013":"This weighty California lookalike nevertheless comes across as balanced, thanks to a long, mouthwatering finish. Citrus and yellow-plum flavors stand up well to a hefty dose of vanilla and buttered toast.","84016":"A pillowy and tropical Chard that doesn't get sloppy soft or overly tart and hard. Toasted marshmallow, pineapple and banana aromas; lightly caramelized pineapple dusted with cinnamon flavors. Finishes with a smoky edge. Best Buy.","84020":"The aromas are so promising, redolent of toast and pears, butter and nectarines, that expectations are high. And make no mistake\u2014this is very good wine. It's just that a slightly resinous veneer of spicy oak largely dominates the palate and finish.","84022":"There's a distinct hardness to this wine, so that the fruit comes across more as a tough-skinned yellow-plum than as a soft, ripe peach. It's a little stingy on the midpalate, but there are plenty of other things to make up for it. Melon and pineapple flavors add layers of interest, as does the toasty, nutty finish.","84028":"A richer, yet no better, style than the 2000 Limestone Coast bottling. Peach and vanilla aromas and flavors take the lead, with buttered popcorn and alcoholic warmth playing supporting roles. The finish is long, featuring a slightly bitter note akin to citrus rind.","84097":"Like some of the other 2008s, this wine seems to be evolving rapidly\u2014a common enough occurence in hot vintages. Apple and citrus flavors still dominate, but the wine is already showing hints of honey and toast. Drink it now and over the next 3\u20135 years.","84106":"Representing a good value in top-flight Cabernet, Jim Barry's 2008 The Cover Drive (a cricketing term) features subtle hints of cinnamon, coffee and vanilla layered over blueberry and plum fruit. It's on the full-bodied side, with plush, velvety tannins balanced by crisp acids. Drink now\u20132018.","84604":"This is a pretty traditional example of Barossa Shiraz, with oak-derived elements of vanilla, chocolate and a touch of dill backed by bold blackberry and deep cherry fruit. It's round and full on the palate, with a finish that fades easily into dusty notes of espresso and cocoa. Drink now\u20132020.","84629":"This wine's full-bodied nature and chunky-blocky texture matches its name. It's dark and brooding in style, with hints of charred meat, asphalt and black olive. Give it some time. Drink 2018\u20132022.","84724":"Minerally and intense on the nose, this Riesling remains fresh and strident right through the palate and onto the long finish. Apple and citrus flavors seem to carry a hint of sweetness, but it could just be the ripe fruit coming through rather than residual sugar. Drink now.","84869":"The Factor is always one of Torbreck's biggest wines. The 2012 continues that tradition, offering ample weight, richness and texture. Alluring notes of Christmas spices and plum pudding mark the nose, while the flavors continue the dark theme, picking up hints of cola and roasted meat before finishing somewhere between creamy and velvety, spicy and peppery. Drink now\u20132030.","84870":"Nashwauk is Kaesler's McLaren Vale project, first released from the 2006 vintage. The 2010 is full bodied, creamy-textured and plush, filled with dark fruit and hints of vanilla, asphalt, maple syrup and mocha. The supple tannins enhance rather than impede the finish, contributing scary length. Drink now\u20132030.","84978":"A terrific value, Plantagenet's 2006 Hazard Hill Shiraz is a silky, feminine-styled Shiraz that starts with smoky, slightly floral notes, then adds in peppery spice, delicate red berries and just a hint of chocolate before leaving your mouth watering on the finish. Drink now.","84979":"Plums, vanilla, toasty oak and a bit of chocolate fudge. The 2007 Angels Share features all of those flavors in a full-bodied, chewy Shiraz. The long, richly textured finish suggests pairing with grilled steak or lamb chops.","84984":"A finely judged blend of fruity and savory, the 2006 Parable marries ripe plums with meaty elements as well as hints of coffee and vanilla. It's round in the mouth and cuddly in texture, finishing with the softness of velvet. Drink it over the next five years.","84985":"Although this is fortified, it's not overly so, with the finished alcohol level resting around 18%. The result is a decadently sweet mash-up of brandy-macerated raspberries that turn chocolaty on the finish. Although it lacks the complexity, tannic grip and minerality of the best true Ports, it's a tasty drop nonetheless. Drink now-2025.","84986":"Tapestry's style is to blend bold fruit with ample oak, and that's the case here, with plum and spice cake notes framed by toast and vanilla. This is a full-bodied, creamy-textured Shiraz, showing some warmth on the persistent, fruit-driven finish. Drink now-2020.","84987":"Hunter Valley Shiraz is somewhat out of fashion here in the U.S., but this is an excellent example of the genre, one that can be taken home and enjoyed tonight. It starts with intense, smoky, pungent leathery aromas, and the fruit is more leathery than fruity in character, yet there's compelling complexity in this medium-bodied, silky-textured wine. Drink now-2015.","85114":"In 5\u201310 years, this rating may look conservative, but right now, this wine's tannins are just too rustic and tough to be certain of its future evolution. It's a massive wine overall, with brambly, briary fruit, tinged with clove, cedar and chocolate, and those drying, astringent tannins on the finish.","85115":"Full bodied and supple, this nicely balanced Barossa Shiraz shows that value still exists even in big-name regions of Australia. Intense blueberry and spice aromas give way to mixed berries and vanilla on the palate, and if it's not overly complex, it's a still a concentrated mouthful of Shiraz at a bargain price.","85116":"This wine's aromas and flavors amount to an inconsistent mix of superripe (chocolate and prune) notes with those that are less so (herbal, tart raspberry) at first, but it does seem to settle down with some time in the glass, becoming more integrated but staying rather crisp on the finish. Drink 2013\u20132020.","85327":"A venture into the deep end of pricing perhaps, but the proof is in the bottle. From vines planted in 1964, this is a rich, full-bodied and creamy-textured wine, with complex notes of smoke, vanilla, plum and roasted meat. Approachable now because of its lushness, it should drink well for at least the next several years.","85332":"From vines planted in 1893, this is an inky, concentrated Shiraz. The aromas hint at cracked pepper, vanilla and blueberries, while on the palate, this is superripe and full bodied. Although close to being fat and overdone, yet it's held back from the edge by its long, licorice-and-spice finish. Drink now\u20132020.","85333":"These 100-plus-year-old vines were transplanted to another site, but continue to yield outstanding wines. Intriguing aromas of fruit compote and roasted meat lead into a palate of blueberry and spice. It's medium to full in body, with supple tannins that finish on a faintly dusty note. Ready to drink now, but should hold at least through 2020.","85336":"Because St. Henri is aged exclusively in large, mostly neutral oak vessels, it often requires more time to come around than Shiraz aged in barrel. The 2009 is tight and reticent on the nose, while showing hints of boysenberry, black olive and roasted meat on the palate. Full bodied, rich and firm in structure, with a long, amply textured finish, it needs a few years in the cellar, and should last at least through 2030.","85395":"De Bortoli's Noble One is as good as ever in 2007, offering intense botrytis, dried apricots, honey and bergamot in a sweetly unctuous style. Think of a Sauternes, but with more sugar and less alcohol. It should age well for 10 or more years.","85412":"Unusual for Oz, in that the primary variety in the blend is Cabernet Franc (74%), with lesser amounts of Merlot (15%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (11%). The result is a fragrant, slightly herbal wine with plenty of red cherry fruit balanced out by vanilla and chocolate notes. It's lighter in body than most Ozzie Cabs, with silky tannins on the finish. Drink now\u20132012. Imported by Margaret River Wines, LLC.","85500":"It's full-bodied and a little warm (14% alcohol), but this also boasts baked apple and citrus fruit and restrained, pencilly, toasty oak. It's lush and mouthfilling without being overblown; rich without being exotic\u2014a well made New World Chard.","85858":"A McLaren Vale standard bearer, the 2010 Hillside is a complex, beguiling example of Shiraz. Toast and vanilla notes frame hints of raspberries, herbs and espresso on the nose, while the flavors add olive-tinged elements. Despite showing ample weight, this isn't the biggest wine, just one that shows impressive harmony and length. Drink now through at least 2025.","85859":"This wine is an excellent value in the world of big, rich Shiraz. While the vanilla and boysenberry aromas seem simple at first, the bouquet and flavors develop impressively with time in the glass, adding hints of roasted meat, mocha and black olive. It's full bodied and rich in texture, with a long, mouth-coating finish. Drink now\u20132025.","86061":"From a relatively cool growing region near Canberra, this shows its origins in its smoke, herb and green-peppercorn aromas. Cherry fruit grounds the palate, which offers a smooth feel and medium body. The slightly herbal note lingers on the finish.","86151":"This unlikely blend of 87% Shiraz and 13% Petit Verdot hits the right notes for a bargain sipper, boasting plenty of weight and an interesting juxtaposition of raspberry fruit with dark chocolate. Earthy notes provide depth, and the finish is surprisingly silky for a wine in this price range. Drink now.","86295":"From 40-year-old vines in the Geelong GI, this is a huge step up in quality from the winery's Jindalee label. Nutty aromas of toasted cereal grain and grilled peaches set the table for this full-bodied, lushly textured Chardonnay. It's rich and ripe, yet reasonably balanced by acid, finishing long and ever so slightly warm. Drink now.","86297":"Despite being a 2004 vintage wine, this top-shelf Chardonnay from Penfolds is still embryonic in its development, shrouded in some smoky, tarry, coffee-like aromas that call for brisk decanting. Underneath, you'll find richly textured layers of ripe, honeyed fruit and grilled peaches, ending with lingering notes of citrus. Drink now\u20132015.","86402":"For such a young wine, this seems surprisingly developed\u2014or maybe it's just riper than usual. It may lack in bracing lemon-lime department, but hints of apple blossoms and tropical fruit turn spicy and a bit apricot-like on the long finish.","86478":"This South Australia Viognier comes across as restrained on the nose, offering up little more than some vaguely smoky or flinty notes, then delivers melon, pear and spice notes via a full-bodied, slightly oily-textured palate. Turns crisp and citrusy on the finish.","86482":"A Rh\u00f4ne-inspired blend of Marsanne (40%), Roussanne (37%) and Viognier (23%), this comes across as rather broad in the mouth, but lacking depth and length. Melon, pear and almond notes make a favorable impression, and the wine finishes fresh, if somewhat simple.","86636":"Light and frothy, with perfumed notes of tangerine, spice and a mere hint of strawberry. Falls off a bit on the finish, but still represents a good value in dessert-style bubbles.","86833":"One of Tasmania's most notable wine personalities, Andrew Pirie, is behind this wine, which aims to compete with prestige cuv\u00e9e Champagnes. Forty percent of the base wine is barrel-fermented, imparting a rich, cashew character that's augmented by two years of aging on lees. It's a complex, medium-bodied wine that's a departure from most New World sparklers.","86934":"A zesty, citrus-accented wine that features aromas and flavors of lemons and limes, piecrust and minty herbs. Finishes clean and refreshing\u2014a racy wine that nevertheless isn't lightweight.","86938":"Understated and less ripe than many Australian Chardonnays, which makes for a nice change of pace when tasting, but also a leaner, more austere style dominated by citrus flavors. This atypical Aussie Chard could even be paired with shellfish.","86939":"New oak and ripe fruit blend together to yield complex aromas of baked apples and pears, complete with a pat of melted butter and a dash of cinnamon. Finishes clean, not cloying, with a distinct Granny Smith flavor.","86944":"Standard stuff, done right. Smoke and toast aromas add nuance to scents of citrus and peach. Hints of vanilla and baking spices buttress apple and pear flavors. The wine finishes with fresh, lemony notes. This is textbook Chardonnay.","86949":"A smooth, easy-to-drink wine made to the New World formula: Sweet caramel, vanilla and peach aromas and flavors, capped off by spicy oak on the finish.","86950":"Filled with bouncy aromas of melon, pear and tropical fruit, this lightweight charmer even blends in notes of butter and anise on the finish. It's a fun wine with the accent on fruit. Best Buy.","86960":"Sure it's oaky, but it's good oak, contributing complex aromas of burnt sugar, smoke and bacon fat to an otherwise straightforward peach-and-pear-flavored Chardonnay. The disparate elements converge in a harmonious finish that invites you back for another sip.","86980":"Toasty and oaky, but in a warm and lovable way, all underpinned by lean citrusy fruit that helps maintain a sense of balance and proportion. There's even a bit of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e thrown into the mix. Finishes smoothly, with nary a rough edge. Best Buy.","86999":"Featuring tobacco, cassis and lesser quantities of mint and cocoa, d'Arenberg's The High Trellis Cabernet is a full-bodied wine that offers plenty of flavor interest and depth at a reasonable price. It does show some slightly chewy, dusty tannins on the finish, but the fruit ultimately wins through, suggesting it will be at its best from 2010\u20132020.","87006":"This is a little slow out of the gate, starting off with some rather cabbage-like aromas. Over time, the odors evolve toward smoke and ash, and, finally, into a complex, cedary aroma. The flavors of this medium-bodied blend (80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Malbec, 8% Merlot, 2% Petit Verdot) feature blackberry and cassis, but also fold in hints of smoked meat and vanilla before finishing crisp and long. This really evolves and improves in the glass, suggesting 10-plus years of potential longevity.","87054":"The Hunter's almost tropical climate shows in this wine's aromas and flavors of roasted cashews, grilled peaches and superripe tangerines. It's medium in body heading towards full, but silky in feel and with mouthwatering grilled notes on the finish. Drink now.","87180":"This full-bodied, muscular Shiraz is built for the ages. Baking spices and plummy fruit form a concentrated, nearly impenetrable wall on the nose, while the palate is nearly dense enough to stand a fork in. Despite all that, it's not overly heavy or fudge-like, instead offering tremendous poise, purity and length. Drink 2020\u20132030, and likely then some.","87196":"This is wonderfully complex and aromatic, with scents ranging from baking spices and savory beef to mixed berries. That swirl of seeming contradictions continues on the palate, backed by luxurious, supple tannins that linger softly on the finish. Drink now\u20132025.","87239":"This is a simple, cherry-dominated fruity quaff at a realistic price. It's only light to medium in body, with crisp acids and a bit of tannic astringency on the finish.","87387":"This is plump, custardy, leesy wine, with ample texture to support the flavors of toasted marshmallow, melon and citrus. It's plush and round on the lingering finish. Drink now\u20132018.","87460":"Selected from four sites planted 40\u201360 years ago, this is a full-bodied, muscular, rich Shiraz. Roast beef notes provide savory counterpoints to ripe plum, chocolate and mint. Long, firm and focused on the finish, where it picks up some mocha nuances. Drink now\u20132030.","87469":"As Australian vineyards go, this isn't that old, having been planted in 1971. Chocolate and vanilla shadings frame bowls of mixed berries in this full-bodied, powerful wine. It finishes long and intense, outlined by dusty tannins.","87622":"This fruit-driven wine doesn't show the complexity of much lees aging, but satisfies with its clean, refreshing flavors of pineapple, peach and melon. It's light in body and nearly dry.","87675":"This is a terrifically full-bodied, lush Shiraz that nevertheless retains a sense of balance and freshness. Vaguely minty, herbal notes make a brief appearance, then give way to raspberry and blueberry fruit. Savory  hints creep in on the palate, further increasing its appeal. This blend of fruit from the Barossa and Eden valleys should drink well through at least 2020.","87678":"With only 10 cases imported to the U.S., one suspects that this terrific wine will largely be found in exclusive restaurants. If you can find a bottle at a reasonable markup, jump on it, for this is one of Victoria's finest Shirazes. Hickory smoke, espresso and herbal notes accent raspberry fruit, whose brightness gives the wine extra lift and dimension. It's creamy and lushly textured without ever seeming heavy, and boasts a long, silky finish that echoes with suggestions of cocoa powder and pulverized coffee beans. Drink now\u20132025.","87823":"Light, off-dry and refreshing, this would make an ideal poolside sipper. Hints of damp moss and fern add complexity to green apple and citrus flavors. Drink now.","88117":"Firmly tannic, this is the rare example of a lower-priced wine that deserves some time in the cellar. There's a sense of coolness and restraint to this wine at first. Hints of menthol lift scents of mixed berries, then develop on the palate into sturdy, chewy fruit flavors and mocha. Drink 2018\u20132030.","88371":"Located in the upper Yarra, this site normally yields Pinots higher in acid and tighter in structure than the Sexton Vineyard. The 2013 marries fruity and savory elements of cherries and mushrooms in a medium-bodied, silky package. It's bright and generous from the bold start to the lengthy finish. Drink now\u20132023.","88372":"To judge by the aromas\u2014a complex herbal m\u00e9lange containing hints of cabbage leaf, tea and acacia blossom\u2014this includes a healthy proportion of stems. On the palate, the black cherry and plum fruit asserts itself, while the texture is crisp and silky, lingering through the finish. Drink now\u20132025.","88373":"This mouthfilling red features lashings of oak, but the bountiful blackberry and blueberry fruit still shines, framed by notes of maple syrup and vanilla. The finish delivers a powerful finale of tannin, but the bold fruit powers through. Drink now\u20132015.","88428":"Classically styled Barossa Cabernet, with plenty of weight and texture, its rich chocolate and cassis aromas and flavors backed by just a touch of mint. Finishes long, with velvety tannins that should begin to settle by 2010 and keep it evolving through 2020.","88544":"A bit fuller-bodied compared to most Australian Sauvignons, but the lime and herbal-grassy notes remain refreshing on the finish. Melon and fig flavors plump up the midpalate.","88557":"This blend of 79% Sauvignon Blanc and 21% Semillon is pungent and sweaty, with an almost Collio-like pungency. It's a bold, in-your-face passion-fruit monster that fades quickly on the finish.","88721":"This may be a touch more elegant than the 2012, but otherwise, it's remarkably consistent. It's medium bodied, with supple tannins framing cherry fruit underlain by hints of beetroot and ground spices\u2014clove, nutmeg and cinnamon. Drink now\u20132024.","88807":"From a producer better known for its red wines, this is a notable white\u2014although there is a slight coppery tinge to the wine's hue. Melon and herbal notes are true to the variety, as is the broad mouthfeel and faint tactile dustiness on the finish. Drink now.","88824":"Fairly full-bodied and lush, with berry fruit flavors balanced by darker notes of chocolate and coffee. The tannins are soft, making this wine immediately accessible.","88828":"Predominantly Grenache, with smaller amounts of Shiraz and Mourv\u00e8dre, but the aromas reflect the Mourv\u00e8dre's tendency toward dark fruit and tree bark. The flavors show some redder fruit flavors\u2014raspberries\u2014as well as touches of caramel and rhubarb, and this slightly syrupy wine finishes with a tangy edge. It's a little eccentric in style and flavor profile, but savory and tasty in its own way\u2014and a relative bargain.","88836":"On the meaty, gamy, savory side of things, with fruit flavors of tart blackberries to bolster hints of coffee and roasted meat. It's full-bodied, then turns crisp, lacking texture on the finish.","88838":"Ripe and Grenache-heavy, to judge by the black cherry and chocolate aromas and flavors. It's medium-bodied, with a tart finish that provides a refreshing counterpoint to the ripe fruit. Imported by Trinchero Vineyards.","88894":"Slightly grassy and pungent on the nose, but this sweet, fizzy Muscat turns more charming on the palate, where hints of pineapple and underripe citrus help to balance out the considerable sugar. Finishes fresh and soft at the same time. Drink now.","89232":"This is 68% Shiraz, 32% Grenache. Compared to the straight Shiraz, this is spicier, showing more leather, clove and pepper. It's still a full-bodied, rich wine, but maybe a bit less plush, with brighter acids.","89308":"Like many Mornington producers, Kooyong has a relatively short track record (founded 1996). For much of that time, winemaking was under the guidance of Sandro Mosele, including this stunning 2012. It shows Burgundian levels of complexity in its array of smoke, leather, root vegetable and black cherry notes, then backs that all up with a firm-yet-supple texture and tremendous length. Drink now through 2022.","89493":"Not a typically fruit-driven Shiraz, Longview's 2007 Yakka boasts pungent scents of smoke, leather and marinated beef, then delivers earthy, meaty flavors. It's full in the mouth, with a creamy texture that turns chewier on the finish\u2014perfect alongside rare beef or lamb. Drink now-2018.","89498":"Starts off dark and a bit brooding, with aromas of plum, espresso and black olive, but shows hints of brighter fruit elements on the palate. Mouthfilling but dry on the finish, this is still very young; decant if serving now, or try 2013-2020.","89565":"This wine has an uncertain future, hence the less-than-enthusiastic rating. On first opening, it's mute on the nose and simply earthy and dull on the palate, with a dry, dusty finish. Later on, it opened up some and showed some nice aged fruit as well, then shut down again. \u2014J.C.","89578":"Seems slightly hollow, and finishes with some coarse oak, but the fruit flavors of cherries and yellow-fleshed red plums are pretty and accented by a hint of smoke. Quaffable. \u2014J.C.","89579":"Grapey and sappy, with almost candied cherry fruit, this is a young wine made to be consumed young. Try chilling it to give the cherry and chocolate flavors greater focus and quaff it with burgers this summer. \u2014J.C.","89580":"The initially effusive nose of strawberries and caramel quiets rather quickly, replaced by cola and tree bark. There's more of the same in the mouth, finishing with a stemmy note. \u2014J.C.","89586":"A 70-30 blend, this wine shows loads of cherry fruit that's surprisingly tart given the wine's loose-knit nature. Finishes with a warm alcoholic glow and hints of damp earth, cinnamon, clove and eucalyptus. \u2014J.C.","89698":"An earthy rendering of Pinot Noir, this features scents and flavors of clean humus, dead leaves, molasses and just a hint of plum. It's medium-bodied, and finishes well, marked by silky tannins and ample length.","89709":"Entry-level Pinot Noir isn't an easy ask anywhere in the world. This one is marked by chocolate and espresso overtones and features a dark, earthy core that's medium-bodied and appropriately silky in texture.","89722":"This budget-priced ros\u00e9 sparkler is earthy and mushroomy, with modest berry flavors, a slightly creamy texture and citrus zest on the finish.","89725":"Cranberries and pie cherries give a crisp, almost citrusy, edge to this wine. The tannins are silky and there's some appealing clove-like spice as well, but the acids are elevated, making the wine come across as tart and ungenerous.","89853":"Somewhat thick and pulpy in texture, with chunky apple, peach and musk melon fruit forming a fruit-cocktail of a Chardonnay. Simple, fruity and clean, with a citrusy note on the finish. Drink now.","89971":"Dry Red No. 2 is virtually all Shiraz, though small amounts of Viognier, Marsanne and Mataro are often included. The 2008 displays slightly vegetal shadings of capsicum and tomato that may prove controversial, but there's ample cassis as well, rounded out by a cedar note. Its medium weight and delicate, silky texture combine to impart those ineffable qualities of grace and elegance.","89975":"Full bodied and richly textured, this is a terrific example of Barossa Shiraz. From its smoky aromas and intense, briary scents to its complex, earthy, spicy flavors with an undercurrent of blackberry, this is a complete package. The long finish is slightly chewy, suggesting that additional aging is warranted. Drink 2016\u20132025.","90249":"Tart, citrusy fruit flavors with some herbal overtones contrast with this wine's ample weight, while the finish is crisp and zesty. Drink now.","90469":"The ample alcohol in this wine imparts a rich slightly syrupy feel to this wine that's not particularly Pinot-like, but still satisfying. Strawberry and raspberry notes carry a hint of tomato leaf, then finish with crisp acids.","90531":"Dried herb and tobacco accent a mix of red and black fruit in this silky-textured wine. Vanilla and menthol notes add more nuance on the nose, while the red fruit lingers elegantly on the long, velvety finish. Drink now\u20132025.","90551":"A dark, inky purple in color, this is a full-bodied (15.5% alcohol) but gentle Malbec, its vanilla, plum and black olive notes framed by supple tannins and a velvety finish. Drink it over the next several years.","90557":"Despite being 51% Sangiovese, this wine comes across as more Shiraz in style, marked by dark, plummy notes, black olive, tar and coffee. It's medium-bodied, with soft, creamy tannins and a reasonably long finish. Maybe the Sangiovese just brightens things a little. Good value.","90564":"The 2014 vintage was slightly cooler than 2013 in the Barossa, which bodes well for Cabernet. This shows aromatic red currants, bay leaf and sage on the nose, then folds in hints of cinnamon and brown sugar. The oak is in the background, letting the fruit carry the wine, yet building in a rich, velvety texture. Drink now\u20132030.","90569":"This is a fine example of what Barossa Shiraz is capable of at a realistic price. It's full bodied and richly textured, plush without being too soft. French oak brings a smoky, bacony element to the ripe blueberry fruit, plus a dusting of baking spices that lingers on the finish. Drink now\u20132025.","90576":"Full bodied, creamy and rich, this wine will undoubtedly please Torbreck fans and provide another piece of ammo for critics. Tasted blind, I wrote, \u201cTorbreck-like nose of lifted spice and stewed berries.\u201d There's a hint of mint as well. Mixed berries and brown sugar notes mingle easily on the palate, while a touch of dried fruit (not a positive) creeps in on the finish. Drink now\u20132025.","90578":"Classic Eden Valley aromas of lemon-lime sherbet and wet stone mark the nose of this medium-bodied wine. That wet stone note carries through on the palate to yield a slightly chalky or crushed-stone texture, while the citrus fruits race through the long finish. Drink 2020\u20132030.","90582":"At a fraction of the cost of the Velvet Glove, readers can try this wine with similar results. It's full, rich and expansive on the palate. Warm waves of ripe berries suffuse the palate, tinged with Mexican chocolate, vanilla and mocha. Drink now\u20132025.","90583":"Creamy and plush may not be traditional Cabernet descriptors, but they're what this wine delivers. Vanilla and graham cracker notes swaddle mixed currant fruit in this big but cuddly teddy bear of a wine. Drink now\u20132022.","90637":"This is a savory style of Shiraz that remains very drinkable. Despite being full-bodied, it's bright and refreshing on the palate, delivering notions of cracked pepper, sour plum and roasted meat. The long finish is simultaneously dusty and mouth-watering. Drink now\u20132025.","90644":"Like it's slightly more elevated cousin, Kay's Block 6 Shiraz, this is full bodied and almost painfully concentrated. Lovely oak-derived notes of cinnamon, vanilla and mocha cosset roasted meat and blueberries, then glide to a long, dusty finish. Drink 2020\u20132030.","90768":"This McLaren Vale winery specializes in blends of Mediterranean varieties, and this is a fine example. It's 70% Mourv\u00e8dre and 30% Syrah, featuring plum, berry and cedary vanilla notes, plus a bit of meatiness on the nose. Richly textured on the palate, it finishes long.","90772":"A bit reticent on the nose, showing hints of struck flint, lime and custard, but this tightly coiled Chard shows its true brilliance in the mouth, revealing complex fruit flavors of lime and lemon, but also slightly riper notes: apple and white peach come to mind. The bright core of acids shines on the long, refreshing finish. Should age comfortably through 2015, at least.","90785":"Although d'Arenberg is better known as a source of hearty McLaren Vale red wines, this tautly balanced, wooded Chard leans toward pineapple and lime. Buttered, toasted hazelnuts add a polished, elegant note to the long, citrusy finish.","90902":"The 2005 Inkwell wines are undeniably big, but they manage to carry their weight and ample alcohol levels with a surprising measure of balance and grace. This one clocks in at 15.7%, but doesn't seem hot or heavy, just mouthfilling and round. Blueberry and blackberry fruit lead the way, but they're joined by earthier notes of black olive, coffee and tree bark. Drink now\u20132010.","90950":"A disappointing blend of wine sourced from Mornington and Yarra, this is a bit pale in color, with a Sherried edge to the fruit and some astrigency on the finish.","91011":"A terrific example of Australian Chardonnay, the 2003 Tiers offers mature aromas of truffles, orange marmalade and peach preserves. It's full-bodied and rich, yet retains a sense of freshness on the long, anise-tinged finish. Drink now\u20132012.","91112":"Oddly confected on the nose, with cotton candy-like cherry aromas, but once past that, this isn't bad wine, even if it's not really varietally correct. It's round in the mouth but with crisp acids, giving it a hard-edged feel, while the flavors are less candied and more like black cherries and chocolate.","91232":"A fruit-driven style of sparkling wine, with apple and citrus notes only slightly touched by yeastiness. It's a bit coarse in texture, but soft and cuddly on the finish, making it easy to back for another sip.","91322":"Wine geeks like to poke fun at Yellow Tail, but there's a lot to like about this offering. It's full-fruited, with plenty of grapy cassis, chocolate and tobacco aromas and flavors, complemented by a thick, velvety texture. Drink now.","91502":"This wine boasts an expansive and complex lineup of aromas and flavors, ranging from dusty earth and cola through plummy fruit and hints of cinnamon and clove. It's plump and round in the mouth, with soft dusty tannins to provide support. Drink now through 2025.","91503":"With a degree more alcohol than Moorooduc's 2013 Robinson bottling, this is a riper, even more richly textured example of Chardonnay. There's a hint of warmth on the finish as a result, but overall it keeps a fine sense of balance. Toast, brown sugar and caramelized pineapple notes lead the way, backed by hints of melon and citrus. Drink now.","91548":"Espresso, blackberry and black olive flavors all come together on the palate of this medium- to full-bodied Shiraz. Hints of leather, plum, menthol and spice add complexity to the aromas, while only a touch of warmth on the finish from its 15% alcohol keeps this from an excellent rating. Drink now.","91553":"Pretty ripe stuff, featuring aromas of brandied fruitcake to go along with its 14.5% alcohol. Plenty of spice, vanilla and toasty oak frames the blackberry fruit, finishing with a touch of coffee. Drink now\u20132012. Imported by International Vines, Inc.","91558":"Shows plenty of palate weight, but very little tannin, combining cedar and vanilla from oak with slightly grapy, black cherry flavors. It's ready to drink now; don't count on aging it for very long.","92057":"A potentially polarizing wine, the 2005 Idyll Vineyard Shiraz boasts a complex bouquet that ranges from meaty and gamy to stewed fruit and coffee and green olive. It's likeable in a stinky-cheese way. In the mouth, the tannins are soft and Pinot-like, but the wine does show a trace of heat, adding a chocolaty note on the finish.","92068":"From the Bowral region, one hour south of Sydney, this is a slightly herbal and green-tinged Pinot Noir, but one with considerable cherry intensity and a woody overlay. It's a good, medium-bodied effort, but could use a touch more richness and complexity overall.","92155":"This is a savory, meaty rendering of Cabernet Sauvignon, boasting aromas of cedar, smoke and soy-marinated grilled beef. Those peppered beef notes carry onto the palate, joined by hints of brown sugar. Full bodied and creamy, it finishes long, framed by supple tannins. Drink now\u20132020.","92230":"Made in a ready-to-drink style, this is a slightly creamy-textured Cabernet that hits the right notes: cassis, vanilla, black olive and a hint of menthol. It's a fruit-driven wine that lacks a bit structure, but will please most palates through 2020.","92416":"This wine's alcohol is apparent from the start, as is a huge oak component and jammy, confected fruit. It's cedary, minty and grapy, with a warm, woody finish.","92668":"This is a nicely put together Chardonnay, offering enough creamy richness to balance the wine's crisp acids. Pineapple and tangerine flavors dominate, lingering elegantly on the finish without revealing obvious oak flavors.","92751":"Made in a rich, opulent style for near-term consumption, Yangarra's Roussanne features exotic notes of toasted hazelnuts, bananas Foster and ripe pineapple. It's full-bodied without being overly heavy, with a long finish redolent of tropical fruit and citrus.","92758":"Despite this wine's 16% alcohol, it does an excellent job carrying it. There's a superripe lift to the aromas of black cherry and a hint of sur-maturit\u00e9 in the notes of apricot preserves, but this is a big, lush, creamy-textured wine with a wonderfully rich mouthfeel and layers of fruit on the finish. Drink now\u20132012.","92772":"In some ways this is the most classically built 2005 Clarendon Hills Cabernet. There's a hint of greeness to the aromas and flavors that are not found in the other offerings, which may make it more or less appealing, depending on your tastes. Mint, cassis and vanilla mingle easily on the palate, which is lush and creamy but shows hints of Cabernet austerity at the same time. Drink now\u20132020. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited.","92884":"This is a jammy, fruit-forward rendition of sparkling Shiraz, with plenty of blueberry and blackberry flavors and a touch of sugar on the finish. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.","92930":"This is wildly aromatic, with floral hints of cracked pepper and apricot lending nuance to the dark berry fruit. The palate is richly textured, leading into a slightly warm, supple finish accented by licorice.","93209":"Plummy and chocolaty in profile, this medium- to full-bodied sparkling Shiraz remains surprisingly refreshing on the long, dusty finish. It makes for a crowd-pleasing introduction to the style.","93313":"For a Grenache-dominated (70%) blend, this shows outstanding structure. the firm tannins are slightly drying right now, but should smooth out nicely by 2012 and the wine should continue to drink well through at least 2020. Ripe cherry and cassis notes are framed by subtle cedary oak, imparting a sophisticated elegance to the long finish.","93478":"This wine shows its age in the dark coffee color rimmed with green. Dates and raisins provide the foundation for complex molasses and rancio notes that build on the finish, where enough citrusy notes provide balance to the syrupy-sweet flavors.","93503":"A full-bodied, very ripe rendering of Shiraz, Mitolo's 2009 G.A.M. offers hints of raisined fruit to go with its notes of coffee, smoke, roasted meat and baking spices. The creamy midpalate and velvety finish make it drinkable already, although it should hold up well for another few years.","93504":"There's an attractive minty note to this wine that some may find too prominent, but the underlying cassis fruit is strong and the wine's structure is firm. The tannins are even a bit chewy at this stage, so either give it a year or two to mellow or pair it with some rare beef or lamb.","94164":"Sparkling Shiraz is an acquired taste, but this is a good introduction to the genre. Simply put, it's a big, oaky Shiraz with bubbles, bursting with vanilla, blackberry, chocolate and cedar aromas and flavors. Enjoy it over the next few years for its youthful exuberance.","94476":"This medium-bodied wine is a stylistic departure from the stereotypical Aussie stainless-steel Sauvignon Blanc, being fermented and aged in old French oak barrels for eight months. The result is a citrusy wine with greater depth and richer texture, even some leesy, slightly toasty notes that complement rather than overwhelm the fruit. Drink now\u20132010, but it could surprise and develop even more interest over time.","94505":"From its floral, lime-driven aromas to its citrus and baked-apple flavors, this is a textbook Riesling. It's plump and friendly, offering a mouthfilling texture and easy-drinking appeal at a bargain price. Drink now.","94684":"Given the paucity of quality Viognier (or any Viognier) for under $15, this is a notable achievement. Musky, melony and spicy, it marries ample weight and breadth with just enough life-giving acidity. Drink now.","94699":"A bit obviously pungent and sweaty, this passion fruit-scented wine is direct and to the point, marrying medium body with a tangy, mouthwatering finish. If you enjoy slightly feral citrus notes, you may rate it higher.","94810":"Not as darkly concentrated or marked by rancio as the Rare bottling (but considerably less expensive), this is still an excellent sweet wine. Earthy notes of caramel and mocha dominate, rounded out by candied dates and wrapped up by a long, coffee-tinged finish.","94892":"Not that much Hunter Shiraz makes it to the U.S. these days, but this bottling from Wyndham Estate is a nice example. It shows rather clean winemaking, with strong vanilla and cedar notes from barrel aging to go alongside blueberry and blackberry fruit. Only mildly tannic, so it's approachable now, but should age through at least 2012.","94900":"This fine offering from Victoria's Mornington Peninsula nails Pinot Noir's elusive texture, gliding across the palate in a silky veil. Cherry-berry fruit is framed by hints of brown sugar, coffee and vanilla, but the oak should integrate with a few more months' aging.","94910":"Imagine a dark, smoky espresso bar, lined with leather banquettes. Mouthwatering scents of grilled meat waft in from a back garden. This is a full-bodied, plush rendering of Mourv\u00e8dre that doesn't show much freshness or fruit yet still caresses the palate.","94969":"This medium-bodied bargain-priced sparkler is maybe just a touch on the heavy side, but it should satisfy most party crowds. Hints of toast accent pineapple and tropical fruit notes, finishing soft and short. Worth trying in Mimosas or Bellinis.","94971":"This wine is very pale in color, but the aromas are anything but understated, zooming out in full floral, orangy Muscat character. It's soft and sweet, balanced a bit by citrusy acids on the finish.","95139":"Reilly's 2007 Dry Land Shiraz is full bodied and velvety textured without being overbearing\u2014trademark attributes of Clare Valley Shiraz. It delivers superripe cherries but wraps them in a cocoon of spicy, savory complexity and soft tannins. Drink now-2017.","95446":"On the lean, citrusy side, but the flavors of pineapple and lemon are married to hints of vanilla and smoke for added complexity. Could use a touch more flesh, but some will enjoy the crispness.","95775":"Round and lush, with boldly oaky notes of caramelized nuts and vanilla accenting tropical fruit. Drink now.","95927":"This 68% Semillon and 32% Sauvignon is intensely herbal on the nose, and the green character persists throughout, yet never veers into vegetal. It's cleanly made and medium-bodied, with a crisp finish.","96207":"American Brad Hickey has turned out a full-bodied, richly textured Shiraz that features a strong savory component. Hints of eucalyptus, roasted meat, espresso and plum all come together to finish long and velvety. Drink now through 2025.","96333":"This is a fine value in weeknight Cabernet, showing supple tannins, regionally distinct aromas and flavors of currants, sage and bay leaf, and subtle oak. Drink this fruit-driven, silky wine through 2020.","96334":"A solid effort at a bargain price makes this Chardonnay doubly appealing. It's medium bodied, delivering oodles of pineapple-tinged fruit and finishing clean and refreshing.","96336":"Australia used to make more blends like this, using the acids of Semillon to balance the ripeness of Chardonnay. In this case, they come together to offer toasty, honeyed notes backed by a strong lemony spine. It's crisp and tart on the finish at first, then relaxes rapidly with airing, so drink it over the next year or so.","96424":"Tasted blind, this wasn't particularly different from the other Rieslings in its flight, which were predominantly South Australian. It's got those same wet stone and citrus tendencies and is made in the same medium-bodied, dry, high-acid style. There's a touch of pineapple as well, plus a long, dry crisp finish.","96597":"A lean, crisp style of Chardonnay, with citrusy flavors and a touch of honeyed development. Drink it over the next few months.","96599":"A fruit-driven Cabernet, with cheerful, bright cherry-berry flavors. Tannins are firm but ripe, accenting the cassis-tinged close with a slightly dusty texture.","96615":"A pronounced herbal note adds a weedy edge to this otherwise full-bodied, plush Cabernet. Cassis fruit is potent without being overbearing, while the oak is prominent, lending structure and vanilla. Drink now.","96708":"This wine from high-altitude inland Victoria is built around acids, not tannins. It's full bodied but bright, lively and refreshing, with crisp cherry and cassis fruit framed by hints of tobacco, vanilla and mint.","96755":"Restrained aromatically, with a slight minerally-graphite note, this is a pleasantly stony wine, perhaps a bit austere. It's medium bodied, ending with a touch of grapefruit pith.","96885":"Lean, tart, angular and edgy, this delivers just what some people are looking for in a Sauvignon Blanc. The fruit is tinged with green throughout, focusing in on lime zest, although there is some yellow plum. It's crisp and clean on the finish.","96950":"A thread of dusty mushroom underlies some pretty raspberry and cream notes in this full-bodied Shiraz, adding an astringent note to the finish. Drink now\u20132025.","97344":"Citrusy and fresh, with dominant aromas and flavors of lemon custard and pineapple. It's medium-bodied and cleanly made, just could use a touch more dimension and richness. Still, it's an easy-drinking Chardonnay suitable as an ap\u00e9ritif or alongside lighter dishes.","97363":"This is full bodied and creamy textured, but still retains a sense of vibrancy and freshness. Black pepper notes help in that regard, spicing up the flavors of plum, mocha and roasted meat. It's plush, rich and long on the finish. Drink now\u20132025.","97384":"Conventional wisdom is that 2004 was a better Margaret River vintage than 2003, but this wine suffers a bit in comparison to its older sibling. Thankfully, it's still very good, with plentiful cassis and red plum fruit, soft tannins and crisp acids.","97950":"More austere and lighter in weight than other Australian Cabernets in this price range, perhaps reflecting its coolish Coonawarra origins. Herb and cherry notes finish dusty and crisp. Might surprise in a year or two.","97953":"A medium-bodied Shiraz suited to everyday drinking, with cherry-berry fruit accented by hints of leather and smoke. It's a fresh, easy quaff to match with burgers or pizza.","97997":"Caramel and butter dominate the flavor mix, imparting the suggestion of movie popcorn and buttered toast, partially balanced by crisp pineapple and citrus fruit.","98038":"Picked on the early side, this is a lean, tight expression of what can be a plump endearing variety. Melon and fresh herbs turn grapefruit as the wine progresses across the palate, finishing tart and crisp. Drink now.","98152":"Full-bodied and lush in style, with aromas of cherries and spice. On the palate, it delivers waves of fresh fruit and hints of cocoa, but also enough complexity to hold your interest before finishing on a long, mouthwatering note. Drink now\u20132016.","98162":"Full-bodied and richly textured, with Penfolds' hallmark weight and structure on full display, the 2008 RWT shows a touch of the vintage's characteristic warmth, but only a touch. The cassis and blackberry fruit is plush, velvety and superripe, ending with hints of tobacco, mint and vanilla. It should drink well for at least a decade.","98238":"Harkens back to the value days of the Diamond Label\u2014but the style has been updated to reflect more freshness and focus. Pineapple and melon notes display cool, citrusy overtones, picking up just a hint of caramel on the finish. Drink now.","98266":"Full bodied, rugged and intense, this is an earthy Shiraz that could use 2\u20133 years of cellaring. Coffee grounds, black olives and savory plums are framed by hints of vanilla and firm tannins that turn a bit drying on the finish.","98336":"Full-bodied, lush and supple in the mouth, this blend of 40% Grenache, 38% Shiraz and 22% Mataro is the Australian version of a barbecue wine, bursting with rich, ripe fruit. Chocolate, mocha and plum shadings dominate, ending on a soft, warm note. Drink now\u20132020.","98443":"One of the more approachable of the d'Arenberg single-vineyard collection of wines, this opens with notes of brown sugar, tarry fruit and bright cassis. It's full bodied and creamy in texture, with flavors of mocha, cassis and vanilla that culminate in a long, dusty finish. Drink now\u20132025.","98805":"Sparkling Shiraz may not be something you pour every day, but this is one worth reaching for. It delivers lots of upfront berry fruit and lashings of dark chocolate, then finishes relatively dry and clean.","99005":"This medium-bodied blend of four varieties (Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache and Mataro) features supremely soft tannins, balanced by crisp acids, while the flavors are a slightly resiny or medicinal\u2014but not unpleasant\u2014blend of mint, cedar, smoke and cherry. Drink now.","99016":"Spicy and herbal upfront, with cassis fruit that seems just a little dried out, giving way to molasses and brown sugar. It's a medium-bodied Cabernet with slightly drying tannins and a coarse-textured finish.","99053":"Supple, round and ready to drink, this blend features hints of tomato leaf, watermelon and clove layered over ripe cherries. Drink now\u20132016.","99068":"This shows off the lovely weight and supple texture of Langhorne Creek fruit alongside bold flavors of chocolate and cassis. Despite that, there's also a nagging bit of green bell pepper that may not be to everyone's taste. Drink now.","99197":"This faintly copper-tinged Pinot Grigio offers ripe melon and apple aromas and flavors. It's medium-bodied, with a refreshing crispness to the finish. Drink now.","99378":"From vines planted in 1912, this has been an icon of South Australia Shiaz since 1952, when it was first bottled as a single-vineyard wine. Menthol and vanilla notes frame black cherries and cassis on the nose, while the palate reveals supple tannins and meaty, savory complexities. The finish is softly dusty, fine and long. Drink now\u20132030.","99391":"This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones. Drink 2020\u20132030, and probably well beyond.","99401":"This rich, opulent wine carries its massive oak load easily, marrying vanilla and toasted coconut notes with ripe plum and black cherry flavors. It's full bodied and plush, with supple tannins supported by the wood. Give it a few years to knit together and drink it 2020\u20132030.","99934":"Clancy's is a reliable Barossa blend that in 2008 is 50% Shiraz, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Merlot. It's a supple wine, the bright cherry fruit framed by tart acids rather than firm tannins. Drink it over the next couple of years.","100319":"Despite reaching its eighth birthday, this is still an incredibly youthful vibrant purple color, with no signs of aging. Aromas and flavors of smoke, toast, black olive, vanilla and cassis are what you might expect from a much younger wine. The tannins are firm, yet the wine is fleshy enough to carry them into a long finish. Drink 2018\u20132025.","100448":"Old-vine Shiraz from the valley floor imparts great richness and a creamy texture to this wine's tannins, framed easily by hints of vanilla. Yet it's not a simple fruit-and-oak concoction\u2014with time in the glass it steadily unfurls to reveal herbal and spice complexities. Marries power and elegance;  drink now\u20132015.","100462":"The most recent release of Penfolds' \u201cBaby Grange\u201d is a beauty, loaded with the chocomint character that has made it famous. Dark berry and cassis take over on the creamy, lushly textured midpalate, finishing long and velvety. Drink now or hold up to 15 years.","100641":"Full-bodied, soft in texture and loaded with peach and melon fruit, this is a tasty everyday Chard. Hints of custard and lime give it additional interest, while the finish ends on a citrusy (orange?) note. Drink now.","100837":"This supple, easy-drinking Cabernet features appealing ripe cassis and vanilla shadings. Hints of black cherry and graham cracker add nuance, while the texture is a bit creamy on the midpalate, turning dusty on the finish. Drink now\u20132020.","100852":"This Riesling shows a bit of honeyed development already, hinting at orange or tangerine marmalade on the slightly abbreviated finish. Enjoy it over the next few years.","100979":"This simple, quaffable red is a solid introduction to the Wirra Wirra stable. Ribena-like cassis notes dominate, picking up hints of vanilla on the palate and finishing crisp and dry.","101169":"A Yarra Valley classic, Dry Red No. 1 is a Bordeaux-style blend marked by its restrained alcohol levels yet potent flavors. The 2007 features scents of tobacco, vanilla and cassis, with a hint of tomato emerging on the palate. It's medium-bodied, with a long finish that finishes with firm but silky tannins and lip-smacking cassis. Approachable now, but should age well for 10\u201315 years.","101268":"Crisp black cherry and mint aromas burst from the glass, then carry over onto the chunky, authoritative palate before finishing slightly dusty and astringent. This medium-bodied Cabernet features plenty of intensity, it just needs a little time to settle down into a more refined package.","101292":"This is a particularly earthy Pinot Noir. Beetroot and mushroom notes are dark and earthy, balanced by bright acids and supple tannins on the palate. The crisp, lean finish shows tremendous focus and length but less generosity. Drink 2018\u20132024.","101398":"A more somber garnet color than some other sparkling Shirazes, with seemingly lower pressure and a more vinous character. Vanilla, leather and cherry notes finish close to dry. A very good, inexpensive introduction to the genre.","101460":"Despite substantial alcohol (16.5%), this admirably concentrated wine doesn't show that much heat, nor does it show any roasted, cooked character. Instead, it delivers black olive, leather and cassis flavors just tinged with mint and a fresh, lively finish hinting at coffee. The tannins are soft but present, helping to balance a hint of residual sugar. Drink now\u20132012.","101670":"d'Arenberg has a quartet of sweet wines from 2008, and this blend of Viognier, Pinot Gris and Marsanne represents a terrific value. It's syrupy sweet, redolent of honey-drizzled, spiced poached pears. To quibble, it could be a touch more complex and crisp, but it is still a succulent mouthful of dessert wine for drinking over the next few years.","101684":"So putting \u201cReserve\u201d on a $13 bottle of wine might seem like a stretch, but the fact is what's in the bottle is very good. It's full bodied, creamy and lushly textured, with an intriguing herbal tang to the black cherry fruit, hints of vanilla and a softly dusty finish. Drink now\u20132018.","101689":"There comes a point when the pursuit of restraint becomes fruitless, and while this wine shows a wonderfully silky texture and an elegant finish, its subtle aromas and flavors of roasted cashew and citrus are indeed understated.","101922":"This wine shows some of the cool-climate notes associated with Western Australia and its maritime climate; green tobacco and other herbs intertwine with bright cassis fruit. At the same time, the fine quality of the tannins is evident in this wine's velvety texture, which makes it a pleasure to drink. Best now\u20132017.","102174":"This vintage of Rocky Gully Riesling comes across as quite ripe and rich despite the modest alcohol content. Smoky hints of struck flint and heating oil spice up flavors of baked apple and vanilla, then linger on the finish.","102217":"Passion fruit, melon and guava flood across the palate in waves of unnuanced tropical fruit. This is medium-bodied and plump in the mouth, with an almost juice-like feel.","102250":"Leads off with dusty, nutty, sugary aromas, like the bottom of the bag of honey-roasted peanuts, but there's also hints of buttered toast, ripe pears and black pepper. Flavors are simpler\u2014caramel and pineapple\u2014and it's heavy on the palate.","102251":"From a cool-weather region, this tangy, slightly sharp Chardonnay aims at a Chablis style and almost pulls it off. Smells ripe, with pear and guava notes, but the palate is less so\u2014grapefruit and lima-bean flavors prevail.","102426":"This is a plush, rounded wine, lacking much edge or cut, yet concentrated and flavorful. Roasted hazelnuts and cashews frame creamy pineapple fruit, ending in soft ripples of citrus. Drink now.","102464":"D'Arenberg wines are typically quite structured, so this wine's full body and creamy texture come as a bit of a surprise. Earthy, loamy notes run alongside espresso, black olive and blueberry before finishing long and silky. Drink now\u20132020.","102475":"Despite it's modest reported alcohol level, this is a plush, rounded example of Chardonnay, loaded with fruit. A whiff of woodsmoke frames pineapple and mango, adding complexity while still allowing the tropical notes to shine through. Drink now\u20132017.","102476":"This is slightly plusher and more powerful than the similarly excellent 2010 Heytesbury, yet still retains an undeniable sense of finesse. Dried herbs and flowers mark the nose, while the flavors include black cherry, cassis and vanilla. On the finish, lingering fruit persists beyond the soft, mildly drying tannins. Drink now\u20132025.","102478":"Fully mature, this is a medium-bodied, creamy-textured sparkling wine that could handle main-course duties. Notes of brioche dominate, filled out by hints of pineapple and citrus, followed by a lingering finish.","102479":"Full bodied and richly textured, this is an approachable wine that should nonetheless drink well through at least 2025. Toasted coconut accents cassis and blackberry fruit, folding in hints of vanilla on the long, mouthwatering finish.","102614":"Smells pure and citrusy, offering up scents of lemon curd, grapefruit zest and lime juice, then adds rounder melon notes on the palate, which is rather fat and shows a bit of alcohol. Zesty on the finish, but warm, too.","102672":"An excellent value, this is a fairly full-bodied, slightly creamy-textured Shiraz that should provide ample pleasure through 2020. Smoky, plummy fruit finishes warm and plush.","102749":"This is a full-bodied yet crisp and firmly tannic Cabernet that appears in need of further cellaring. A prominent eucalyptus character accents notes of cassis and espresso, while the finish is a bit tough and gritty at this stage. Try 2018\u20132025.","103001":"You've got to like oak to appreciate this wine, which is presently dominated by scents of vanilla, mocha and toasted coconut. It's full bodied and velvety in texture, with hints of black cherry lurking in the background.","103002":"Mouthfilling and round, this wine's savory notes of roasted meat, mocha and cracked pepper frame plummy fruit. Vanilla creeps in on the long, supple finish. Drink now through 2025.","103004":"A solid value, the 2013 Pillar Box offers oodles of blackberry and plum fruit, framed by vanilla and accented by mocha. It's creamy-velvety in texture, with a rich long finish. Drink now through 2025.","103112":"Made in a restrained, perhaps age-worthy style, Leeuwin's 2008 Art Series Shiraz offers up cassis tinged with hints of mint and tobacco. The tannins are silky in texture, while the wine never strays past medium weight. Drink now\u20132020.","103186":"A step up from the other Syrahs in the 2008 Clarendon Hills' lineup, the Astralis is firmly tannic and should be long-lived. The masses of rich black-cherry fruit are amply framed by cedary oak without ever being overwhelmed, with the fruit persisting on the long finish. Try around 2018.","103307":"Like all of the Yering Station Reserves, this one shows a healthy whack of new oak, but there's plenty of ripe cherry fruit to support the vanilla and cedar nuances. It's medium bodied, plump yet suave, with a long finish that echoes vanilla and spice. Drink now\u20132019.","103359":"Already showing a bit of bricking, this is a full-bodied Shiraz that's a bit coarse in texture, with aromas and flavors of plum and brown sugar. The finish matches tart, zingy fruit with sweet, molasses-tinged oak. The individual components show promise, but it's tough to say if they will all come together in time.","103370":"Light to medium in body and rather tart, with leather and dried cherry notes that are submerged under an excessively medicinal character.","103382":"The wine looks a touch amber-like at the rim, with aromas of butterscotch and cracked pepper. The flavors carry a bruised-fruit character, and the wine seems a bit flabby on the palate. Not up to this project's usual high standards.","103422":"Hungerford Hill's vast array of wines includes this savory Shiraz, which features ample leather, tar, black olive and coffee flavors. It's fleshy and supple on the palate, with softly lingering tannins on the finish. Drink now\u20132017.","103466":"Coonawarra is Cabernet country, but this Chardonnay is a solid contender. Subtle toast and citrus aromas show admirable restraint, while there's ample weight and the flavors of pineapple and melon finish clean and citrusy.","103581":"This Southern Hemisphere adventure from an Austrian winemaking family can turn out some interesting wines. In this case, it's a medium-bodied wine that's firm yet silky in feel, marrying cassis and tobacco leaf with subtle, balanced oak.","103606":"D'Arenberg's Coppermine Cabernets are often tannic and austere upon release, so be warned should you decide to open one in the next year or two. The aromas and flavors are classic this year, seamlessly marrying cassis and cedar, but finishing dry, astringent and firm. Drink 2020\u20132030+.","103644":"Of all the various d'Arenberg Shiraz bottlings, this may be the silkiest in texture this vintage. It's still a full-bodied wine, filled with savory, earthy notes of black olive and espresso, but the finish stands apart for its length and suaveness. Drink now\u20132025.","103651":"Like so many of the 2010 Shirazes from South Australia, this is a terrific wine. It's full bodied and creamy in texture without going over the top, and the bold, oak-derived aromas of toast and vanilla ably frame flavors of black olive and plum. Already very drinkable, it should still be going strong in 2020.","103725":"This medium- to full-bodied sparkler is pleasantly dry in style. Perhaps the bubbles accentuate the cedar, vanilla and baking spice aromas, but there's plenty of blackberry fruit to carry the palate and a long, dusty finish.","103752":"A terrific deal, this is as varietally correct and rich a Viognier as you'll find for the price. Honeysuckle and apricot notes are carried by a slightly oily texture, yet the wine finishes long and elegantly. Vegan. Drink now.","103961":"This bottling is less ebullient than previous vintages, but that only makes it more appealing. It still has its hallmark blackberry, spice and cocoa shadings, they're just in better overall proportion and balanced by more of an earthy, savory streak. The tannins are ripe and silky, the fruit bright on the finish.","104096":"This partnership between the Rh\u00f4ne's Michel Chapoutier and his American importer seems remarkably consistent. Peppery clove aromas presage a medium-bodied, silky wine that combines spice with black olives on the midpalate. It's long, finely textured and espresso-tinged on the finish.","104101":"At six years of age, this is just coming into its own. Hints of green fruit remain, tempered by notes of wet stone and toasted marshmallow, harbingers of the full maturity that will arrive in a few years. It's not as lean or edgy as it must've been as a young wine, but is rounding beautifully into form. Drink now\u20132025.","104102":"It's good to see this Margaret River stalwart return to the States. The 2015 DJL is a slightly nutty, toasty wine, plump and silky in texture. Pear, melon, vanilla and citrus notes finish long.","104123":"The 2015 vintage in Mornington yielded dark concentrated wines. This one is atypically (for the estate) full bodied and bold as a result, with plum and black-cherry fruit and hints of mint, sage and bay leaf. Long and a bit drying on the finish, it needs a couple of years to come into balance. Drink 2020\u20132030.","104275":"This is a medium-bodied, richly textured Chardonnay that deserves a place on any table. Grilled pineapple and peach notes convey ripeness without excessive oak or weight, finishing long and plush. Drink now\u20132020.","104282":"This juicy, medium-bodied Shiraz is filled with mouthwatering cherry-berry fruit. Some silky tannins provide structure, but this is much more about the here and now than any sort of cellaring. The fruit persists through the finish, joined by hints of herbs and bacon. Drink now\u20132020.","104283":"It's been some time since Katnook last submitted samples, so it's reassuring to see that quality there remains high. This medium-bodied Cabernet boasts crisp acids and fine tannins, highlighting notes of red currants, olives and bay leaves. Drink now\u20132025.","104284":"Free of restrictive appellation contr\u00f4l\u00e9e regulations, Chapoutier's Australian team blends 85% Viognier and 15% Marsanne in this intense, concentrated white. Yellow plums and grilled pineapple notes aren't exceeding complex, but offer plenty of enjoyment, finishing ripe, rich and long. Drink now.","104287":"Classic hints of mint mark the black-cherry and cassis aromas of this wine. On the palate, the fruit is reasonably restrained but pure, barely touched by dried spices and cedar, then glides to a silky finish. Drink now\u20132020.","104432":"A unique blend of spice and blueberry sets this Shiraz apart from the pack, and it pulls away even further due to a lush, creamy texture and long, mouthcoating finish. There's great purity to the fruit, but enough peppery spice for complexity. Drink now\u20132016.","104433":"The price keeps creeping up, but at least this is one Australian wine that consistently delivers vintage after vintage. The 2004 offers classic aromas of cassis, cinnamon and clove, with a touch of cracked pepper for good measure. It's full-bodied without going overboard, with a rich texture and a long, clean finish filled with complex spice notes. Good now, should be even better in 10 years.","104473":"A different vintage from the odd-numbered ones surrounding it, 2014 yielded wines of less ripeness and intensity. Despite that, this is a fine effort, offering overtones of green peppercorns, dried spices and fresh herbs over tart pie-cherry and cranberry fruit. It's taut and focused, silky without being soft. Drink 2020\u20132030.","104772":"There's a slightly scorched character to this wine that I had a tough time getting past. There's solid plummy fruit, but also recurring hints of freshly sawn lumber and burnt coffee. It's full bodied, with plenty of astringent tannins, so it might age past this current stage, and it's possible this rating could look stingy in a few years.","104819":"This easy-to-drink blend of 50% Shiraz, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Petit Verdot starts off jammy, with black cherry liqueur and clove notes before settling down and developing some interesting peach and mocha nuances. The persistent finish, lined with velvety tannins, makes it stand out from the crowd. Best Buy. \u2014J.C.","104834":"Filled with bright, bouncy cherry-berry fruit and imbued with a slightly viscous mouthfeel, this fun, gulpable Shiraz won't break the bank. Its easygoing nature makes it worth having on hand for your next barbecue. \u2014J.C.","104917":"Full bodied and supple, this wine shows an interesting array of sensory notes for Barossa Shiraz, with notes ranging from espresso, tar, mint and green peppercorn to dark chocolate and blueberry. Finishes long and softly dusty, suggesting the ability to age through 2020, although it's very drinkable now.","105094":"Prickly refers to the wine's texture, which is definitely lightly frizzante (spritzy). That helps boost the wine's aromas, making it perfumed and floral, even Muscat-like. It's light in body and slightly off dry, with notes of apricot, apple blossom and gingery spice. Drink now.","105178":"Streamlined and tart, this is a citrusy version of Chardonnay that showcases unadorned lemon and pineapple flavors.","105344":"Starts off a bit leathery and lacking fruit, but somewhere along the way raspberries start folding into the otherwise savory mix of leather and black olives. Medium in body, turning tart and tea-like on the finish. Drink now-2012.","105673":"Like all the Duval wines, this is amply structured. Cedar and vanilla notes frame dark fruit flavors in this blend of 51% Shiraz, 30% Grenache and 19% Mourv\u00e8dre. Its full bodied, with a long, dusty finish. Drink now\u20132022.","105681":"The blend of 56% Grenache and 40% Shiraz also includes 4% Sagrantino, said to enhance structure. For its size, the wine is remarkably restrained, combining slightly resinous cherry fruit with hints of cinnamon, clove and mint. The finish is supple, suggesting early drinkability. Enjoy now\u20132017.","105907":"As might be expected from winemaker Roman Bratasiuk, this is a full-bodied, rich Syrah, loaded with dark scents of roast coffee, blueberries and baking spices. Blueberry, menthol and spice flavors dominate the palate, finishing long. Despite the massive richness, there's plenty of elegance, too. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited.","105912":"Already approachable, Mitolo's 2006 G.A.M. should nevertheless age 10\u201315 years. The aromas are slightly peppery and spicy, accented by hints of smoke, while the flavors are dark and savory, blending cedar, coffee, black olive and cola. The soft tannins amply frame the long, mouthwatering finish.","105925":"Like all of the Clarendon Hills wines, this is packed with intensity. It's full-bodied, with soft tannins and a slightly low-acid, natural feel. Aromas of menthol and roasted meat are backed by hints of blackberry and licorice on the palate and a long, lingering finish. Drink now\u20132020. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited.","106296":"Redolent with melon and pineapple, this medium-bodied unoaked Chardonnay is simple, fruity and clean, with a tart, citrusy finish. Drink now.","106472":"Straightforward Australian Shiraz, combining mulberry fruit with vanilla oak. It lacks richness and expansiveness on the palate. A solid effort, but a bit of a disappointment given the history of the label and the suggested pricing.","106523":"This blend of 45% Grenache, 28% Shiraz and 27% Mourv\u00e8dre does show a trace of heat in its finish, but is otherwise a pleasant, medium-bodied sipper at a realistic price. Tart, slightly minty cherries feature undercurrents of chocolate and coffee, turning crisp and lemony on the finish. Drink now.","106534":"Known more for its red wines, Wolf Blass nevertheless makes a creditable Chardonnay for $12. hints of vanilla and toasted almond mark the nose, while the fruit flavors veer toward citrus and stay there, turning lemony on the finish.","106644":"Smells and tastes slightly sour, with simple flavors of pineapple and citrus that finish with a tart edge.","106762":"Firmly tannic, this is the rare example of a lower-priced wine that deserves some time in the cellar. There's a sense of coolness and restraint to this wine at first. Hints of menthol lift scents of mixed berries, then develop on the palate into sturdy, chewy fruit flavors and mocha. Drink 2018\u20132030.","106769":"This is less opulent and full bodied than most Australian Viogniers, but it still delivers an attractive blend of white peaches, citrus and baking spices. It's crisp and bright enough on the finish to handle a wide range of seafood dishes. Drink now.","106962":"From young vines, this is a somewhat austere, ungenerous rendering of Pinot Noir. The tannins are a bit drying, offsetting the attractive flavors of cola, plum and fresh minty herbs.","107010":"In so-called Penfolds years, when the stars align for the company, smart money is on the Bin series of wines like this Bin 407 Cabernet. It comes close to the luxury Bin 707 Cabernet in terms of quality, but at a much lower price, boasting ample body and velvety tannins. Hints of cedar, mint and mocha accent concentrated cassis and plum flavors. Drink now\u20132018.","107013":"Clarendon Hills is best known for its Syrah and Grenache, but it is no slouch when it comes to McLaren Vale Cabernet. The 2008 Hickinbotham is full bodied and velvety in texture, with ample notes of cocoa and crisp cassis. Hints of mint and other herbal shadings give it varietal character and welcome complexity. Drink it over the next 10\u201312 years.","107027":"Lush and creamy on the palate, this complex wine boasts flavors of slightly mossy, decaying cedar, molasses, damp earth and leather, all wrapped around a bright core of red berry. Supple and lasting on the finish. Drink now\u20132020.","107272":"Like so many unwooded Chardonnays, this is a medium-bodied, pleasantly fruit-forward wine that's clean, simple and direct. Tangerine scents lead into flavors of mixed citrus and a crisp finish. Drink now.","107382":"This isn't the biggest, baddest Cabernet. Instead, it's more of a charmer\u2014lithe and crisp. Cherries and dried herbs on the nose add hints of earth and pepper on the palate, then finish with a gentle wash of dusty tannins. Drink now\u20132018.","107502":"Nearing maturity, this is a full-bodied, rich Chardonnay despite weighing in at only 12.5% abv. Scents of custard-meringue pie become more pungent and savory with air, adding hints of roasted mushrooms, smoke and maybe even some bacon fat. The flavors are savory yet the fruit remains, culminating in a long, ripe-citrus finish.","107614":"Petit Verdot is a character actor who's never really grabbed the spotlight for itself, but makes an interesting appearance now and again. This McLaren Vale example is oaky but backed by ample plum and cassis fruit and framed by tannins that seem soft for the variety. Cedar and spice come through on the finish. Drink now.","107620":"This is a bit chunkier and less suave than De Bortoli's more expensive estate bottled Shiraz-Viognier, but it's still a very nice wine. Peppery spice marks the nose, while the flavors feature a nice blend of plum with savory notes of coffee and black olives. Drink now\u20132015.","107628":"This medium- to full-bodied Shiraz features a welcoming mix of mulberries and vanilla, overtaken by cedary flavors on the finish, where the fruit turns crisp. A slab of charred steak would match the woody notes nicely. Drink now\u20132013.","107764":"A good wine at a good price, the 2006 Jim-Jim Shiraz offers bouncy raspberry fruit, hints of cracked pepper and vanilla and a medium-bodied, reasonably lush mouthfeel. Multiple U.S. importers.","107827":"A bit unyielding on the nose, then the palate shows rather tight and citrusy flavors. Yet there's ample weight on the palate and a long, fresh finish tinged with hard peaches and pineapple. This seemingly contradictory wine just needs some time to develop; try after 2009.","107888":"This release is always among my favorite Aussie Rieslings. Not only is the quality consistent, the price for a nearing-maturity wine makes it a winning value. It is smoky and toasty on the nose, showing off those developed aromas to good effect against a background of bergamot-tinged fruit. The round patina of age is balanced by great acid drive and a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now\u20132020.","107890":"This wine starts off with an appetizing, savory, grilled-meat element on the nose, then showcases flavors of dark chocolate, mocha and plum. It's hefty on the palate, with a velvety texture and long, rich finish. Drink now\u20132027.","107894":"From a single vineyard planted in 1908, this Semillon is just entering its window of drinkability, where it should remain for at least another 10 years. Scents of fresh lime juice and grilled toast lead the way, backed by flavors of limes and mandarin oranges. It's medium in body, plump yet tightly focused, with a lengthy finish full of toast and citrus zest.","108042":"Mitolo's top Shiraz offering from 2007 is its Savitar bottling, from McLaren Vale. This full-bodied, creamy, lush, expansive wine features aromas of toast and vanilla upfront, followed by mixed berries that seem to grow in intensity with every sip. Drink now-2020.","108301":"This light- to medium-bodied Shiraz is crisp and tart, yet also shows some dried-fruit character on the finish.","108423":"Combine masses of American oak with high ripeness and the result is this warm woody wine oozing with vanilla, molasses and cedar. It's full and plush, but lacks complexity and cellaring potential. Drink it now.","108603":"Despite being priced as an entry-level blend, this doesn't show much in the way of forward fruit. Instead, it's grippy and tough, with a veneer of dry, woody tannins over flavors of vanilla, cedar and cinnamon.","108688":"Having earned its reputation as one of Australia's finest Chardonnays, the challenge is then to maintain that level of quality. The 2010 Art Series certainly does that. Enticing aromas of woodsmoke, peach and pink grapefruit give way to intense flavors of citrus and stone fruit on the palate. It's full bodied, yet with great focus and length, ending crisply despite the wine's inherent richness. Drink now\u20132020, perhaps longer.","108692":"Like virtually all of Penfolds' top-end reds, this is full bodied and densely concentrated. As it's aged solely in large vats, there's no oak influence and the wine needs a bit of bottle age to come around. For now, it's a bit monolithic, showing hints of mint, black olive and ripe raspberries before ending long and fine. Drink 2017\u20132030, and perhaps beyond.","108992":"Hints of pungent boxwood mark the nose of this lean, narrowly constructed wine. The flavors are grassier, \u201crounded out\u201d by tart citrus and green tomato notes. Drink now.","109113":"This medium-bodied Barossa blend displays supple tannins and a silky finish, making it immediately accessible. Hints of smoke and sweat and complexity to the currant aromas and flavors.","109294":"Is there any doubt that 2012 is a superb vintage for South Australian Shiraz? Here's another fine example, boasting sumptuous levels of black cherry fruit framed by hints of brown sugar, roasted meat, cinnamon and allspice. It's full-bodied and richly textured, with a long, velvety finish. Drink 2018\u20132030.","109295":"On top of being made from organically grown grapes, this wine is vegan friendly. Of course, that means nothing unless the wine is good. Thankfully, this wine is excellent. Apricot, honey and ginger notes mingle easily on the palate. Drink this full-bodied, slightly open-knit wine over through 2017.","109379":"This round, soft, alcoholic wine deserves praise for its spicy-peppery warmth and abundant cherry fruit. Those same qualities are also its biggest shortcoming: The low acidity and high alcohol make it seem a bit heavy. \u2014J.C","109383":"Packed with grapey, plummy fruit, smoke and vanilla, this is solid entry-level stuff. It's not particularly rich or concentrated, but it is something that's uncommon at this price: balanced. That makes it an attractive by-the-glass option or barbecue companion. \u2014J.C.","109454":"This wine is dark brown in hue with a greenish-gold tint to its rim, providing clues to its advanced age. The aromas are nutty, with mossy notes of rancio filled out by sweet flavors of dried dates and figs. It's full bodied and unctuous in texture, without being overblown or heavy on the palate. The intense finish lingers forever\u2014or at least until you give in and take another sip.","109461":"D'Arenberg's lineup of single-vineyard Shirazes is especially impressive in the 2010 vintage, and this was one of my favorites. The aromas are tight, nearly impenetrable at first, then only stubbornly yielding hints of graphite, but the mouthfeel is expansive and richly textured. Aristocratic notes of pencil shavings balance supple tannins and layers of dark fruit, concluding in espresso and chocolate on the finish. Drink now\u20132030.","109842":"A lively, medium-bodied dry red for casual meals, this is a good example of Australian Sangiovese. Red berry fruit is backed by crisp acids and firmish tannins, making this a good candidate to pair with burgers or pizza. It's 85% Sangiovese, with the balance Merlot and Shiraz.","109900":"This is a medium-bodied Riesling that seems destined for rather early consumption, as it lacks the fine edge of acidity that distinguishes age-worthy examples. Apple and lime flavors are tinged with gingery spice on the finish.","109946":"From vines that were 171 years old when the grapes for this wine were harvested, this is packed with dark berry fruit, then layered with vanilla, cedar and mint. It's full, plush and warm, just too big, intense and bulky for current consumption. Best from 2020\u20132030.","109966":"Wakefield (known as Taylor's in Australia) was founded as a Cabernet-focused estate. While the range has expanded over time, Cabernet Sauvignon remains a strength. Brown sugar and cedar frame cassis fruit on the nose; the palate shows just enough juicy, mouthwatering fruit to support the ample oak. This is full bodied yet supple, with crisp acids showing on the finish.","110025":"Mixed berries, cracked pepper and baking spices mark the nose of this red, a blend of 52% Shiraz with 48% Cabernet. It's full bodied and supple on the palate, with spice notes accenting mulberry and cherry leading into a softly dusty finish tinged with cocoa. Drink now through 2020.","110028":"Shiraz (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (28%) and Malbec (12%) combine in this medium-bodied silky-textured blend. Hints of eucalyptus linger around the margins, while the core of the wine features raspberry and cherry fruit. It's soft and easy to drink, and made for near-term consumption.","110045":"This full-bodied Shiraz is muscular yet supple, with soft tannins framing dark, savory notes of sour plum, black olive and brown sugar. The long finish adds mocha and roasted meat nuances to the complex mix. Drink now\u20132025.","110055":"This intriguing effort starts off a bit odd, hinting at scents of maple syrup, mint and tomato. Thankfully, it quickly rights itself, morphing into a complex herbal m\u00e9lange laced with mocha and plum. There's a sense of restraint to it on the midpalate, but then a surge of vibrancy on the long, velvety finish. Ready to drink.","110245":"Despite the reasonable price tag, this is a very good bottle of Cabernet, the kind that should be poured by the glass at your local steakhouse. The mixed berry and cedar flavors are easy to like, and it has enough crisp acidity and silky tannin to stand up to rare beef without being overly heavy or rich.","110402":"This style of Barossa Semillon is a far cry from that practiced in the Hunter Valley. This version is medium to full bodied, with waxy, pineapple notes and a crisp, linear finish that features just a hint of honey. Drink now.","110559":"Lime sherbet and wet-stone aromas are classic for the variety and region. This is a light- to medium-bodied wine, dry, with high acidity that drives it through a long, zesty finish. Drink it now with raw oysters or ceviche, or cellar it another five years to develop greater weight and complexity.","111073":"Once thought to be Albari\u00f1o, this grape variety is actually native to France's Jura. In this example from South Australia, it's a lean, crisp white, with hints of pencil shavings that accent its grapefruity flavors. It's pretty, harmonious and a good all-around white for drinking over the next 6\u20139 months.","111224":"This medium-bodied Grenache features vanilla and raspberry compote on the nose. It's a smooth, if not particularly textural wine, with berry flavors and hints of toast that fall away on the finish. Drink now.","111234":"This crisp, delicate Pinot Noir should be consumed over the next few years for its elegant cherry and rose petal notes and silky tannins. Hints of scorched earth and dry leaves add extra interest to the reasonably complex bouquet.","111294":"Full bodied and richly tannic, Lehmann's 2006 Mentor is dark, chocolaty and intense, with further nuances of cassis and cigar box. The finish is chewy and juicy, simultaneously drying and mouthwatering. Drink 2015\u20132023.","111618":"An excellent value, the 2010 Shotfire Shiraz offers bold, punched-up cherry-berry fruit framed by hints of vanilla, dried herbs and cracked pepper. It's a big wine that's reasonably creamy in texture, with plenty of mouthcoating flavor on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.","111675":"This is a bright, medium-bodied blend of 65% Shiraz, 31% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Malbec. Herbal notes on the nose suggest mint, thyme and bay leaf, layered over hints of cassis and red berries. Not overly tannic, this is a drink-now proposition.","112101":"This affordable bottling offers intensely concentrated fruit nicely accented by hints of cedar and mocha. The tart, mixed-berry flavors are crisp and mouth-watering, finished off by a dusting of cocoa powder on the finish.","112150":"This medium-bodied white features attractive scents of lime zest and pineapple. On the palate, the flavors veer toward apple and citrus, which fade rapidly on the finish. Drink now.","112484":"The nose of this wine features some delicately lifted floral scents, but also darker notes of brandied cherries and asphalt. Give it some breathing time to let the tarry notes fade and allow the red cherry and cinnamon red-hot flavors to emerge. Finishes long, mouthwatering and just a touch warming. Drink now\u20132014.","112486":"Leaving aside the suggestive name and packaging, this is a very soft, almost pillowy-tender 80% Shiraz blend, with a fair bit of complexity. It starts with scents of hickory, cedar and vanilla, adds plum and black cherry fruit, then hints at espresso and black olive on the finish. Drink now.","112493":"Mixed aromas of vanilla, Christmas spices and brandied black cherries give an almost dessert-like impression, although the wine is technically dry. The texture is creamy and luxurious, and the wine is very easy to drink despite its considerable weight, balanced by a tart edge of acid on the finish. Drink now\u20132012.","112505":"The Ironstone Pressings features enough rough edges at this stage to think it will benefit from a few years of cellaring. The tart cherry notes are angular, the tannins a bit chunky, but tea leaf and spice notes provide ample complexity. Try in 2013.","112870":"Searching for New World Chardonnay that's restrained, crisp and only 12% abv? Steve Webber at De Bortoli is your man. This medium-bodied Chardonnay displays a hint of custard to its texture, while the flavors are citrus driven and refreshing.","112875":"Starts off rather Rh\u00f4nish, with hints of white pepper and grilled meat, then offers tart cherry fruit on the palate, accented by those same savory elements. The tannins are modest but silky, and the acids turn up while the flavors thin out just a bit on the finish. Drink now\u20132014.","112881":"This blend of Petit Verdot (40%), Grenache (29%), Shiraz (29%) and Mataro (2%) ends up being a pleasing recipe at an even more pleasing price. Mulberry, plum and vanilla flavors emerge from the glass, while the mouthfeel is full and lush. Probably best over the next year or so.","113046":"This is a lush, amply oaked wine, brimming with the things that make Margaret River Chardonnay so lovable. Grilled bread and fruit abound, pushing forth peach, pineapple and melon flavors through a soft, espresso-tinged finish. Drink now\u20132020.","113138":"This is a plump, succulent Chardonnay for drinking by the end of 2016. The apple, citrus and pear notes are pretty simple, but clean, with a long, refreshing finish.","113171":"Plum and raspberry fruit, intriguing spice notes reminiscent of allspice and cardamom, and ample weight and suppleness make this bargain-priced offering a winner. Drink now.","113173":"This is a bright, medium-bodied blend of 65% Shiraz, 31% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Malbec. Herbal notes on the nose suggest mint, thyme and bay leaf, layered over hints of cassis and red berries. Not overly tannic, this is a drink-now proposition.","113327":"Aromas of pear and anise pace the nose of this medium-bodied wine. It's a simple, fruit-cocktail-like sipper, with a quick, easy finish and a reasonable price tag. Drink now.","113453":"At 15% alcohol, it does show a trace of warmth on the finish, but this is a full-bodied, richly textured wine of great appeal. Cassis fruit dominates, with hints of cherry, camphor and asphalt adding nuance. Best from 2012\u20132018.","113459":"This firmly built Merlot shows almost Cabernet-like reserve in its tobacco, cherry and cassis shadings that finish woody, warm and firm. At the moment, the copious oak sits atop the fruit, suggesting at least another 2\u20133 of cellaring prior to full enjoyment.","113463":"With the number of really good dessert wines available for under $12 per bottle severely limited, this is a refreshing ray of golden sweetness. Dried apricots add enough citrus pith to partially balance out the intensely sweet flavors. Drink in the lusciousness over the next couple of years.","113676":"With only 30 cases imported, you might have to search a little to find this, but if you happen to stumble across some, don't hesitate. It's a very good Pinot Noir, with varietally correct aromas and flavors that range from flowers to cherries, all framed by hints of coffee and vanilla.","113837":"At seven years of age, this is a reasonably complex wine, well suited to pair with roasts. The ample oak is integrated with the fruit, yielding a m\u00e9lange of nuances that include grilled meat, cedar, vanilla, dried spices, coffee, black olives, blackberries and tar. Drink now\u20132015.","113838":"A strong effort for this Penfolds bottling, the 2004 Bin 128 features powerful aromas of chocolate and cassis, then follows up with slightly more nuanced flavors that add brighter berry notes to the mix. Tannins are silky-smooth, suggesting early drinkability, although it should age well until at least 2015.","113875":"Fresh mint and cracked pepper accent dark plummy fruit on the nose, picking up hints of dark chocolate and black olive on the palate. It's full bodied, creamy in feel and loaded with supple tannins, which make the wine approachable now, but should sustain it through at least 2025.","114283":"Paler than typical for Australian ros\u00e9s, this is more in the style of southern France. It's light to medium in weight, with a crisp, refreshing feel and bright berry and lime zest flavors. Drink now.","114288":"Featuring some dusty tannins on the finish, this is fairly structured for Aussie Grenache. Dried herbs and dried cherries are balanced by hints of dusty earth on the long finish. Drink 2013\u20132017.","114293":"A superb value, this wine's weighty presence and rich texture convey the warmth of the Barossa without ever stepping over into overripeness. Instead, it delivers mixed berry fruit, peppery spice and overtones of vanilla and chocolate. Drink now and over the next few years.","114298":"Interestingly, Sidewood's 2008 Reserve Shiraz comes in considerably lower in alcohol than the regular bottling. It features a complex interplay of herb, spice and olive that gives it a stylistic resemblance resemblance to northern Rh\u00f4ne Syrahs. The tannins are silky, the finish long and balanced. Drink now\u20132018.","114593":"This wine sees less new oak than many top-of-the-line Shiraz (30%), so it showcases mulberry and black cherry fruit. Sure, there's a hint of vanilla, but the oak plays a suitably supporting role, while the ripe fruit tannins are rich and velvety on the midpalate, then firm up a bit on the finish. Drink 2018\u20132030.","114767":"A subtle smoke component adds nuance to the aromas of peach and pineapple. The flavors match up precisely, adding a touch of marshmallow to the mix. This is fairly full bodied, yet lacks a bit of depth and flesh in its midpalate and finishes warm. Drink now.","114775":"This is an interesting blend\u2014the proportions are 46% Riesling, 34% Sauvignon Blanc and 20% Marsanne. Passion fruit and white currants notes dominate, with hints of tomato stalk. It does taste slightly off dry, fading quickly on the finish.","114870":"Dark amber in color, with some greening evident at the rim, this Tokay features aromas of scorched coffee and Guinness stout-like flavors, but is also sweet, with hints of molasses and raisins. It's a solid effort, representative of its classification.","114945":"An intense, flavorful rendition of Sauvignon Blanc, this is grapefruity from start to finish, balanced by slightly riper notes of pineapple and a custardy richness to the wine's texture. Pair it with bold fish dishes over the next 6\u20139 months.","114949":"Pronto red is 77% Grenache, with the remainder a blend of Touriga Nacional (11%), Syrah (7%) and Monastrell (5%). It starts off with leather and spice, then folds in cherries and licorice. It's full-bodied, round and slightly warm, with a supple, spice-driven finish. Drink now-2015.","114959":"Nicely rounded in texture without being flabby, this is a lively, crisp white wine, well endowed with flavors reminiscent of melon, pear and lime. Perfect to drink now with most seafood dishes, or as an ap\u00e9ritif.","114964":"This Shiraz does a nice job of balancing its fruit-sweet characters of blackberry and blueberry with savory elements of herbs and green olives. It's full-bodied, warm and creamy-textured, with a warm, chocolaty finish. Drink it now and over the next few years.","115153":"Although labeled Shiraz, this wine also includes 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Viognier. Those additions help account for its impressive color and rich mouthfeel. Vanilla and cedar frame mixed berries, yet the wine remains savory and complex, adding hints of black olive, mocha and grilled meat. Drink this dense, full-bodied wine now through 2025.","115315":"Toasted marshmallow aromas lead the way, underscored by hints of white peach, vanilla and citrus. The palate is broad at first, then progressively narrows into tight, crisp notes of lemon and orange zest on the finish.","115534":"Really appealing on the nose, with smoky, meaty scents that give the impression of a Shiraz that's savory, yet packed with fruit. But the wine is less impressive in the mouth; it's soft and cuddley\u2014deliciously ready to drink\u2014without anything apparent in reserve. Drink now.","115709":"The blend is 53% Chardonnay, 44% Pinot Noir and 3% Pinot Meunier. The wine is a classic traditional-method sparkler, with modest biscuity notes and understated fruit. It's light to medium in body, with a dry, scouring finish.","115854":"This is almost confectionery in its fruit sweetness, layering raspberries over black currants in wave after wave. There's a hint of mint as well, ample weight and power on the palate and a long, dusty, tannic finish. Drink now\u20132030.","116343":"A nicely balanced red. It's not the richest, deepest wine out there, but it does offer plenty of red plum and raspberry flavors, framed by vanilla-scented oak. It's reasonably long on the finish, too, where the wine picks up attractive cedary accents.","116347":"The 2004 vintage favored Cabernet, and that quality has evidently trickled down to this bargain from Penfolds. Hints of brown sugar and raisin on the nose give an impression of great ripeness, but that's balanced by fresh black currant, coffee and black olive flavors. Tannins are supple, but finish on a slightly dusty note, giving the wine enough backbone to pair with steak.","116355":"Ferngrove's entry-level Shiraz includes 5% Viognier, but it avoids any Viognier-derived stone-fruit character, instead yielding up savory spice scents, a hint of mint and ripe blackberry and plum flavors. Tannins are soft, with acid providing the needed structure. Pepper and clove on the finish bring this bargain to a satisfying close. Drink now.","116363":"Comes out of the chute showing a funky, rubbery edge, but that blows off with a little time to reveal dark, somewhat earthy notes of cola and blackberry. It's medium-bodied, with good length to the finish, where it picks up enough dusty tannins to give it backbone.","116409":"Reminiscent of some Paso Robles red wines, this superripe Shiraz has some sweetly grassy or alfalfa-like aromas to go alongside blackberry and chocolate flavors that lean toward coffee and caramel on the finish. It's round in the mouth, the tannins ultrasoft; drink now. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.","116542":"Dominated by rather simple cherry aromas and flavors, this is a mouthfilling, nicely textured wine that just lacks the complexity to elevate it to the next level. Tart acidity and some warmth on the finish provide a piquant counterpoint to the gobs of fruit. Drink now. Imported by Cellar Door.","116803":"Like the 2003, this is a big, no-holds-barred Shiraz. The 2005 is packed with cassis and blueberry fruit, framed by chocolate and vanilla notes and finishes with plenty of spicy complexity and some slightly rough tannins. Drink 2010\u20132020.","116898":"This dark-fruited, full-bodied Shiraz isn't for the faint of heart. Espresso, dark chocolate, roast meat and plum notes come together in a creamy-textured wine that finishes with a tart, hard edge of acidity and a dusting of cocoa powder-like tannins.","116899":"Yes, the same Jacob's Creek that turns out vast quantities of drink-me-now wines at sub-$10 price points also makes this age-worthy Cabernet from Coonawarra fruit. The 2008 is a harmonious wine, blending notes of cassis, cigar box and vanilla into a richly textured, fairly tannic whole. Give it 4\u20135 years in the cellar.","116901":"The Lodge Hill Dry is a solid performer year-in and year-out. This vintage shows a hint of fuel oil alongside green apple, bergamot and clover notes. It's a fine, medium-bodied dry Riesling that broadens out just a little on the long finish.","116902":"Lean and tightly focused, this looks like one for the cellar\u2014try it around 2018 if you can wait. Right now, it shows modest, restrained citrus fruit, hints of wet stone and a wickedly long, sinewy finish.","116905":"This is floral on the nose, offering up hints of talcum powder and restrained fruit. Yet the apple, cinnamon and lime flavors bust out on the palate before ending in a long, potent, citrusy finish. Drink now or hold up to 10 years.","116906":"Yalumba's western outpost has been steadily improving the quality of its wines, and the 2010 21 Barriques represents its top wine to date. The dark fruit flavors are accented by ample amounts of charred oak, but the fruit ultimately wins out. The result is a very drinkable, silky textured wine with a long, toasty finish. Drink now\u20132020.","116909":"Vintage after vintage, this wine impresses for its complexity and balance, and the 2009 won't disappoint on those counts. It may not be the biggest, baddest Dry Red No. 2, but it features blueberry fruit and espresso and black olive shadings, a lovely supple texture and a softly lingering finish. Drink it over the next few years.","116914":"Cullen's 2010 Mangan captures the great potential of the vintage. It's a youthful, juicy mouthful of berry fruit accented with cedar and vanilla oak, but where the wine really shines is its texture, which is richly silky, with a fine dusty quality reminiscent of cocoa powder or ground cinnamon. Drink it now and over the next several years.","116921":"This is more Cabernet Franc than anything else, but includes some Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. One of the region's signature reds, the 2009 offers cherry and cranberry fruit alongside hints of cigar box. It's soft enough to be approachable now, yet remains stuffed with tannin. Try after 2015.","116922":"The plumpest of Frankland Estate's three single-vineyard bottlings in 2012, Netley Road offers subdued lime and tobacco aromas, then flavors of tangerine and pineapple. It's softer than the others, but displays an attractively chalky element to the textured finish. Drink now\u20132020.","117010":"This pale salmon ros\u00e9 starts off with scents of crushed stone and underripe stone fruit, then shows riper flavors of plum and peach on the palate before ending on notes of watermelon rind and citrus. Drink up.","117062":"A blend of northern Barossa and Eden Valley fruit, this is a firm, full-bodied wine. American oak-derived notes of vanilla and cedar frame crisp plum and blackberry fruit, then add dusty notes on the long finish. Drink 2018\u20132030.","117172":"Already developed, with hints of toast and marmalade on the nose and showing baked apple and citrus flavors on the palate. This plump, medium-bodied Riesling finishes with a touch of honeyed softness, suggesting it should be consumed over the next year.","117547":"Wet stone and lemon-lime. If those sound good to you, this ageworthy Riesling is a fit for you. It's medium in body yet very crisp and linear in structure, with a hint of citrus pith on the finish. Drink 2015\u20132020.","117582":"Marlargo appears to be a reasonably successful attempt at fashioning a pan-Australian brand, sourcing fruit from different parts of the country. This Clare Riesling starts with scents of talcum powder and lime sherbet, then follows those up with similar flavors. It's muscular and taut, even a bit austere, clocking in at only 11.4% alcohol. May develop through 2015.","117600":"It's dark and inky in color and concentration, filled with superripe blackberry and plum fruit edged in chocolate and mint, but it seems to lack a bit of richness and texture on the midpalate despite its 15.2% alcohol. Ends with vanilla and tangy fruit and a touch of warmth. Drink now\u20132015.","117710":"Strawberry and watermelon come together in this tart, medium-bodied dry ros\u00e9. The juicy red fruit doesn't offer much complexity, but is refreshing and easy to drink.","117724":"This wine's flamboyant aromas of passion fruit and cut grass are unfortunately not quite matched on the palate, where the flavors are more restrained. It's medium in body and rather lean, with a crisp, fully dry finish. The blend is 69% Sauvignon Blanc, 31% Semillon.","117994":"Full bodied, muscular and intense, this brooding Shiraz is built for the cellar. Smoke and blackberries are crunchy with acid and primary fruit, finishing crisp. Drink 2018\u20132025.","118003":"A terrific value in sparkling wine, this slightly copper-tinged bubbly features classy aromas of dried thyme, citrus and apple. On the light-bodied palate, there's a hint of creaminess and the merest suggestion of strawberry, although apple and citrus dominate. A great option for summer entertaining.","118134":"Shiraz (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (28%) and Malbec (12%) combine in this medium-bodied silky-textured blend. Hints of eucalyptus linger around the margins, while the core of the wine features raspberry and cherry fruit. It's soft and easy to drink, and made for near-term consumption.","118141":"This isn't overly flashy or pungent on the nose, but does show some Sauvignon-like notes of green onion and white grapefruit. In the mouth, it's crisp and lean, with flavors of grapefruit and underripe pineapple that hint at wet stone on the finish. Drink now.","118143":"Cranberries and pie cherries give a crisp, almost citrusy, edge to this wine. The tannins are silky and there's some appealing clove-like spice as well, but the acids are elevated, making the wine come across as tart and ungenerous.","118148":"Call me traditional, but 100% American oak (roughly one-third new) doesn't quite harmonize with sparkling Shiraz, at least in this instance. It's given a sappy, resiny, almost hoppy character that lingers on the palate, marrying uneasily with the black cherry fruit.","118155":"What a big difference a year can make on the Mornington Peninsula, which juts daringly out into the Southern Ocean near Melbourne. This is lightweight and tart, revealing hints of decaying leaves, fruit reminiscent of pie cherries and virtually no tannin.","118157":"This is appropriately light to medium in body, with a tart, crisp finish, but also shows some slightly Sherried aromas and tired fruit.","118166":"Let me confess upfront: creamed corn was one of my favorite side dishes when I was a child. That said, it's not something I like in my wine, and this medium-bodied Chardonnay shows an excess of those sweet corn and lactic aromas and flavors.","118231":"The blended Pinot Noir from Dalrymple equals (or even exceeds) the single-vineyard bottlings on occasion. The 2012 is sturdy yet elegant, with ample weight joined by a silky texture on the long finish. It smells earthy, yet delivers cola, dark cherry and plum flavors.","118410":"This is really lean and tightly focused, seemingly built for aging\u2014or for drinking young with raw oysters. Complex aromas of damp moss and petrichor give way to simpler flavors of mixed citrus that finish long and tart. Drink now\u20132025.","118413":"This reasonably full-bodied Chardonnay manages to retain a sense of freshness and crispness throughout. Subtle oak and vanilla notes frame peach and pineapple fruit, while the finish is long and citrusy clean.","118612":"This Chard comes down on the citrusy side of things, with just enough nectarine flavors to round out the more angular lemon and lime notes. It's medium-bodied, but boasts plenty of acidity to give it zest on the finish.","118614":"A good value, this Chardonnay delivers plenty of mouthfilling flavor for the price. Pineapple and melon fruit is tinged with a touch of mint, and while the flavors may be somewhat simple, at least they're assertive.","118620":"Don't let a slight hint of burnt-match aroma bother you\u2014just decant this wine to aerate it before serving. Crisp apple, pineapple and citrus flavors are fresh and straightforward, showing decent length and intensity.","118732":"With its pungent scents of cracked pepper and potent berry aromas, this is not a shy Shiraz. On the palate, it delivers an intriguing blend of vanilla and berries, marked by more sauvage elements of peppercorn and grilled beef, all wrapped in a sturdy, well built package of ample weight, adequate acidity and dusty tannins. Drink now\u20132020. Imported by Tom Eddy Wines.","118808":"There's three words you need to know to understand this wine: vanilla, vanilla and vanilla. Sure, there are some hints of coffee, and just enough plummy, blackberry fruit to support the heavy-handed oak, but this is Shiraz of a distinct style. If you like lavishly oaked wines, this one is for you.","118820":"This winery always seem to offer a more European style of Shiraz, combining slightly earthy, dusty notes with savory hints of spiced meat and fresh dark-berried fruit. The 2004 shows a fair amount of complexity allied to firm tannins and crisp acids, and will probably require another 4\u20135 years to show its best.","118839":"Medium-bodied, crisp and firmly tannic, this Cabernet still needs a few years to come into full bloom. Cassis, leather and vanilla notes merge together on the finish, joined by dusty tannins. Cellar until 2020.","119040":"This plush, full-bodied Cabernet comes across as slightly Shiraz-like, but still represents good value for $15. Smoky, toasty notes of charred oak frame black olive and cola notes, while some red fruit does peek through from time to time. Drink this ready-to-drink Cabernet through 2020.","119043":"This longtime favorite seems to have gotten sweeter over the years, and I think it's about reached its limit, as there's just enough acidity for a semblance of balance. Floral notes of roses and berries burst from the glass, while the flavors feature juicy summer berries and a hint of chocolate.","119050":"This Cabernet Sauvignon is already approachable. It's full bodied and supple, showing a little lightening at the rim. Cherry, earth and herbal notes take on hints of anise and chocolate on the finish. Drink now\u20132020.","119062":"Made in a deliberately moderate-alcohol style, this is a medium-bodied wine with no bells or whistles. Leafy notes hint at fresh greens, while the flavors are more green fig and white grapefruit. Drink now for zesty refreshment.","119263":"On the nose, this has a high-toned tang that distracts slightly from its other scents of vanilla and raspberry. On the full-bodied palate, a crunchy mix of red and black fruit comes to the fore, but deep, savory notes of espresso and black olive emerge on the finish.","119264":"Considered on their own, d'Arenberg's 2011 single-vineyard Shirazes are successful, although they lack some of the pizzazz of the 2010s. This was one of my favorites, teeming with pepper-tinged blueberries and accented by hints of roasted meat and espresso. It's full bodied and richly textured, with a long, velvety finish.","119265":"Somewhat restrained yet undeniably potent, this wine boasts a lovely blend of cassis, cinnamon and cedar. It's medium to full in body, with a long, dusty finish. Drink now\u20132025.","119554":"A strong effort from Cimicky, the 2008 Trumps displays ample complexity in its hints of chocolate, coffee, cedar, blueberries and baking spices, then puts all of that in a soft, creamy, mouthfilling package tinged with licorice on the finish. Drink now.","119707":"John Duval (ex Penfolds) has finally released a varietal Grenache, a wine that's quite different from the blends and Shirazes he's done up until this point. This is supple, full in body and round, without the firm structural elements his wines typically possess. Dare I say it's hedonistic? Black cherry and cinnamon notes are juicy and mouthwatering on the long finish. Drink now\u20132020.","119821":"Understated plum, earth and spice aromas give an indication that this is not a casual, fruity Grenache. It is warm and supple, yet features enough dried-spice complexity to merit slow sipping and even savoring the lingering finish.","119978":"This is full and richly textured without being overdone. Crushed stone and cracked pepper aromatics give it a nose that resembles some Northern Rh\u00f4ne examples, while the fruit is earthier and tinged with blackberries, then finishes with dusty tannins. Drink now\u20132020.","119983":"This 50-50 blend is firm, focused and rich, offering attractive aromas of mint, vanilla, cedar and red-skinned plums. Flavors turn darker, suggesting espresso and chocolate, but enlivened by bright acids. A wine worth holding a few years, priced at $20? Buy now, drink after 2020.","119991":"Without any new oak or lees stirring, this wine's sole focus is on the fruit. Pineapple, melon and peach notes are pure and striking, supported by just hints of vanilla and cream. This medium-bodied Chardonnay finishes in a flurry of tangerine and lime.","120006":"This is nearly equal parts Shiraz, Mataro and Grenache, full bodied and creamy in texture. Black cherries and peppery spice show up on the nose, while the palate adds brighter red raspberries, bass notes of ripe plums, sweet hints of brown sugar and savory, meaty complexity. Drink now\u20132020.","120011":"Vanilla, cedar and mint notes mark the nose, while this wine boasts just enough fruit on the plate to carry the lavish oak. It's full bodied, creamy and supple, amply concentrated but still very approachable. Drink now\u20132023.","120039":"This classic Barossa Shiraz is full bodied and lush, with velvety tannins and a long, mocha-tinged finish. Cedar and vanilla notes frame mixed berry fruit\u2014raspberries and blackberries. Drink now\u20132025.","120344":"This full-bodied, even slightly viscous, effort from Penfolds displays dark notes of blackberry and chocolate on the nose, then adds touches of coffee and black olive into the mix on the palate before finishing tangy and crisp. Drink now\u20132016.","120528":"The Baker's Gully Syrah is the entry-level offering from Clarendon Hills, but it remains a very good wine. It's medium to full in weight, with some alcoholic warmth and hints of slightly raisined fruit, yet charms for its velvety-soft tannins and aromas of chocolate and baking spices. Drink now.","120533":"This is a good value in the plush superripe style of Cabernet that seems to be popular these days. The velvety mouthfeel easily carries bold vanilla and plum flavors over the palate, partly balanced by a savory-spicy element. Drink now.","120545":"When a producer renowned for its red wines can turn out an elegant, understated white of this quality, you know Australian Chardonnay has firmly arrived. Subtle accents of toasted nuts frame citrusy fruit, and while the wine is full-bodied and round in the mouth, it remains focused and long and on the finish. If you're fortunate enough to get some of the 600 bottles imported, drink the wine over the next couple of years.","120550":"A mature, mossy (in a good way) Shiraz, this seamlessly blends cedar and vanilla shadings with dark berry notes. It's medium to full in body, with solidly savory and earthy underpinnings that make it especially easy to match with food. Drink now\u20132018.","120551":"A terrific value, the 2012 Mount Crawford offer sup a big hit of lime on the nose, but also intriguing brine and talc notes that add extra dimension and complexity. It's a medium-bodied wine with ample texture and a long, layered finish. It may not age as long as some other Eden Valley Rieslings, but it's delicious now, so why wait?","120552":"A terrific value, this blend of 60% Grenache, 20% Mataro and 20% Shiraz features a forward bouquet of slightly jammy mixed berries. The palate showcases vibrant red fruit on a supple bed of tannins, capped off by a savory, tapanade-laden finish that makes it more than a simple fruit bomb. Very silky and drinkable, it's the ultimate wine-bar wine, as the name suggests.","120557":"A terrific value, this 50-50 blend displays gentle oaking and a hint of warm asphalt, just enough to highlight the wine's plum and black cherry fruit. It's full bodied and features a long finish, outlined by wonderfully fine, dusty tannins. Drink now\u20132018.","120860":"This is a fairly big, creamy-textured Chardonnay to consume over the next couple of years. Grilled sweet corn features, but it's backed by ample citrus and peach fruit, and the finish remains crisp and refreshing.","120862":"This fits the mold of Clare Valley Riesling perfectly. Struck flint notes give way to bright citrus on the nose, followed up by pineapple, cardamom and cinnamon flavors. It's dry to the point of austerity, framed by a slightly dusty texture, yet boasts mouthwatering acids on the long finish. Drink now\u20132025, possibly longer.","120870":"Penfolds' Bin 51 is a perennial winner, although the price has been steadily creeping northward. The 2014 is dry and medium-bodied, but fragrant\u2014think flower-shop greens, gingery spice and citrus\u2014and with a welcome bit of texture on the long finish. It should drink well for 10\u201315 years.","120871":"The winery has kindly aged this bottling for you and is charging a relatively small premium for the service, so this is one to snap up if you can find it. Hints of grilled toast, marmalade and honey remain dry on the palate and extend through a long finish. Ready to drink.","121083":"A pronounced herbal note adds a weedy edge to this otherwise full-bodied, plush Cabernet. Cassis fruit is potent without being overbearing, while the oak is prominent, lending structure and vanilla. Drink now.","121447":"Full-bodied, plush and velvety, this is smothered in fine French and American oak. As a result, the aromas and flavors all tend toward sweet and brown, ranging from brown sugar and maple syrup to mocha and caramel.","121470":"Smells leathery and savory, then folds in ripe, plummy fruit on the mouthfilling palate. Finishes supple and softly dusty. Ready to drink now.","121523":"Mocha and cracked pepper notes accent earthy flavors of black olive and dusty plum. This is full bodied and creamy in texture, with a long, velvety finish that suggests early drinkability, from now through 2020.","121524":"Despite some plum fruit, this single-vineyard Shiraz tracks more to the savory side, blending notes of espresso, earth, roasted meat and black olive. It's full bodied and slightly creamy and dusty in texture, with a long finish.","121675":"Starts off with scents of apples and citrus, and maintains that fruit-forward focus all the way through. It's medium-bodied, with a slightly creamy midpalate and a touch of lemon custard on the finish.","121681":"Plump and fleshy for an unoaked style, with tangerine, lemon and passion fruit notes that finish clean and refreshing. A good summer wine at a fair price. Imported by USA Wine West.","121687":"This medium-bodied Chardonnay starts off with some slightly nutty-almondy scents that might be mistaken for oak, but on the palate the fruit speaks loud and clear. Pear and lemon flavors ring out the loudest, followed by a refreshingly citrusy finish.","121689":"Attractively priced, the Sydney Chardonnay from Nine Stones features fresh, citrusy flavors of tangerine and grapefruit, backed by the merest hints of toast and vanilla. It's medium in weight, finishing crisp and with surprising length.","122017":"Made in an accessible, fruit-forward style, this medium-bodied wine features ample blackberry fruit and just hints of vanilla and cedar. Perhaps because of the Viognier component, it's already supple on the palate, yet the finish displays tart acids and some dusty astringency. Drink now\u20132020.","122023":"Unlike most Australian Rieslings, this one is a bit sweet (off dry, really). Hints of honey and bergamot bring complexity to the ripe, peachy flavors of this muscular wine, finishing with a dusty, tactile sensation. Drink now-2025.","122086":"For a wine at seven years of age, this is remarkably undeveloped. Hints of celery leaf and apple accent tart citrus fruit, still mouthwateringly crisp. There's some richness on the palate, but hold through at least 2020 if you prefer mature notes of honey, marmalade and toast.","122434":"Despite this wine's weight and richness, it retains a superb sense of balance and structure. Firm acids and tannins support the blueberry fruit, while savory notes of mocha and roasted meat provide added dimension. Give it a few years in the cellar and drink it from 2015\u20132025.","122443":"These blends are traditional in Australia\u2014they're just rarely this good. The 26% Cabernet gives great backbone and a sense of restraint to the wine, which might otherwise seem overdone or sloppy. Instead, there's a blend of blueberry and cassis fruit, Port-like spices and a long, dusty finish. Drink 2015\u20132025, possibly beyond.","122501":"This is clean, refreshing white blend at a realistic price. Grapefruit and fig aromas lead the way, followed by a plump mouthfeel and flavors of ripe fruit. Drink now.","122612":"Already showing hints of maturity, this plush, open-knit blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 42% Merlot and 3% Cabernet Franc offers seductive aromas of cigar box, vanilla, mint and saddle leather. No, it's not a fruit-driven wine, but those savory aspects and velvety tannins will pair well with roasts or braises. Drink now\u20132023.","122633":"Probably the wine that put Australian Chardonnay on American consumers' maps, the current vintage boasts aromas of creamery butter, tangerine and lime, with a touch of movie-theater popcorn. Soft peach and vanilla flavors finish with spicy oak.","122641":"Big butterscotch\u2014aromas and flavors\u2014come close to drowning out some of the finer nuances of this wine, which include green apples, citrus fruits and dried spices. Spicy oak and tart lemons linger on the finish.","122704":"Closer in style to a light red wine than a traditional dry ros\u00e9, this is dark pink\u2014nearly pomegranate\u2014in color, and boasts hints of leather, berries, dried herbs and white chocolate. Textured and round in the mouth, the only quibble is its relatively quick fade on the finish. Drink now.","122715":"Clean, crisp and easy to drink, with raspberry fruit accented by subtle wood spice and cedar elements. Tannins are soft, making this a Shiraz to drink now and over the next few years.","122716":"Rosemount's Diamond Label Chardonnay used to be a terrific value, so it is encouraging to see its quality once again on the rise. Smoky notes add complexity to the bold pear and melon fruit in this plump, harmonious wine; drink it over the next few months.","122829":"A 60-40 blend, this full-bodied, creamy textured, lush wine captures the sun of McLaren Vale without taking it too far. Vanilla, licorice and plum notes mark the nose, while the plummy flavors pick up mocha shadings before turning a bit fudge-like on the long, velvety finish. Drink now\u20132018.","122830":"After spending 20 months in a mix of French and American oak, this full-bodied Shiraz is imbued with seductive notes of vanilla and baking spices. But there are also plenty of plummy fruit and savory undertones of espresso and roasted meat. It's supple enough to drink now, although it should last through at least 2025.","122831":"This supple, savory Shiraz is approachable now. Hints of vanilla and black olive accent mixed berry fruit, while the texture is rich and creamy. Meat and mocha take over on the long finish. Drink now\u20132020.","122833":"How can one not applaud a winery that holds back some of its top Riesling for a museum release at such a reasonable price? Developed honey and cinnamon notes accent citrus fruit, adding weight and richness to the midpalate while still finishing crisp and completely dry. It's drinking well now, but should easily hold another 10 years under its screw cap.","122951":"Full-bodied and plush yet vibrant and imbued with fresh fruit, this is simply superb. The oak is present but never dominant, adding brown sugar and cinnamon elements to blueberry, roasted meat, espresso and black olive notes. A hint of peppery spice also creeps into this impossibly complex wine. The finish combines power, length, freshness and dusty tannins, suggesting that while impressive now, it should age well. Drink now\u20132030.","123088":"Epitomizes in many ways the emerging Barossa style, marrying huge fruit and creamy tannins with more restrained oak use. Licorice and peppery spice lead the way, backed by notes of plum, cola and even roasted meat. Lush and long on the finish. Drink now-2020.","123103":"Aged in 100% new French oak, this wine opens with scents of vanilla and pipe tobacco, but also shows a strong core of ripe raspberries. Mixed berries take over on the palate, softly framed by layers of mocha and vanilla. This full-bodied wine's tannins are creamy in texture, just turning ever so slightly dusty on the long finish. Drink now-2023.","123105":"Full-bodied, lush and velvety, the 2006 Ben Schild Reserve is ready to drink now and over the next 8 years. Hints of espresso and black olive impart complexity to the plum and blueberry fruit, and a licorice note chimes in on the softly textured finish.","123126":"This plump, succulent wine is a solid value. Understated toast frames pineapple and melon in this fruit-driven style. Drink this crisp, appealing quaffer now\u20132018.","123142":"The Ratbag makes for a pleasant, if somewhat generic dry red. Dried fruit and prune notes are complemented by chocolate overtones and the mouthfeel is soft and user-friendly.","123148":"There are some attractive dried-spice notes built into this wine, but on the whole it's dominated by confected, jammy berry fruit. The texture is slightly syrupy, and the wine finishes soft. Despite the impressive moniker, it's an easy, entry-level Shiraz for the casual drinker.","123159":"For the price, this is a commendable effort, with scents of toast and vanilla layered over modest cherry fruit. The wine is medium bodied and marked by the a fine, soft texture, then finishes on a tart note.","123213":"This wine displays plenty of weight and an unctuous texture alongside aromas and flavors of toasted nuts. There's also a strange herbal note, elements that are decidedly egg-like, and a long, honeyed finish. File it under \u201cintriguing,\u201d and drink it over the next several months.","123260":"Impressive for its balance of soft, creamy richness with bright, juicy raspberries. Notes of brown sugar, cinnamon and espresso add a layer of decadence surprising at this price.","123363":"This medium-bodied Barossa blend displays supple tannins and a silky finish, making it immediately accessible. Hints of smoke and sweat and complexity to the currant aromas and flavors.","123431":"Lavish vanilla and cedar nearly take over this wine, leaving just enough dark, plummy fruit to peek through, yet the wine remains true to its varietal roots in its silky mouthfeel. A bitter coffee note sneaks in on the finish. Seems ready to drink.","123483":"The 2006 Chertsey is a blend of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon, 47% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 100% French oak. The oak's vanilla and cedar notes provide a foundation for the wine's cassis and plum flavors, cosseting them in soft tannins. Drink now\u20132018.","123794":"Sourced from the Wilybrup subregion of Margaret River, this is a full-bodied, creamy-textured Cabernet, readily accessible at five years of age. It's meaty and savory in style, with ample chocolate notes, hints of asphalt and plummy fruit that lead into a long, gently dusty finish. Drink now\u20132025.","123945":"One of the plusses to having a cash-flow brand like Yellow Tail in the portfolio is that it gives the owners the opportunity to properly age their high-end wines prior to release. At 10 years old, this has acquired a veneer of silkiness and elegance that enfolds the cassis and red-currant fruit. There's no shortage of smoky, vanilla and brown-sugar inflected oak either. Drink now\u20132025.","123965":"Full-bodied and rich, this is a traditional style of Barossa Shiraz, aged in American oak hogsheads. Faint menthol or dill notes and plenty of vanilla frame plum and mulberry fruit, while hints of green peppercorn and maple syrup add interest to the long finish. Drink now\u20132030.","123966":"Only released in top vintages, this is Jim Barry's luxury cuv\u00e9e of Cabenet Sauvignon. It does see plenty of oak, so it shows impressive notes of baking spices, vanilla and brown sugar, but it backs those with ample dark fruit. It's elegant despite its size, with a fine-grained tannins lingering on the finish. Drink now\u20132025, and possibly beyond.","123970":"Full-bodied, rich and chewy, this is a big, bold wine. Ample oak frames black cherry and cassis fruit, adding hints of vanilla and dark chocolate to the fudge-like impression. Warmth suffuses the palate, but doesn't quite progress to full-blown high-alcohol heat. There's no doubting its impressive intensity and ripeness. Drink now\u20132025.","124071":"White peach and toasted grain aromas ease gently into a plump, custardy mouthful of melon and stone fruit. Balanced nuttiness frames the wine, giving it just enough structure on the elegant, plush finish. Drink now\u20132020.","124083":"Less effusive on the nose than the Mort's Block, this boasts notes of tangerine zest and lemon. This dry, medium-bodied Riesling hints at riper fruit flavors yet stays resolutely citrusy through the long, electric finish.","124085":"Grilled-toast notes swirl around the bouquet of this cassis-scented wine. Leafy elements add complexity without being green, while a lifted cherry element brings vibrancy to the mix. This firm, structured wine features a long, mouthwatering finish that bodes well for cellaring. Try it after 2020.","124106":"Herbal and lean, with hints of sweet charred oak and tart cherries that combine to yield a slightly confected impression on the palate. Drink now.","124193":"The hints of menthol and cherry on the nose are appropriately restrained for the style. This medium-bodied wine is still tight and young, but should blossom after 2020, based on the length of its mouthwatering finish.","124264":"A round, corpulent style of Chardonnay, nutty and rich but balanced by crisp apple and citrus notes. A bit of Eden Valley Riesling provides the wine's freshness.","124266":"Starts off with herbal aromatics that come surprisingly close to vegetal, but seems to gather itself with some time in the glass, adding rich chocolate and cassis aromas and flavors to the mix. Dusty tannins and a balanced but tight feel suggest a few years in the cellar. Drink 2010\u20132020.","124267":"A soft, easy-drinking sparkling Shiraz, much like Schild's still versions. Toast, vanilla and blackberry aromas and flavors are creamy-textured in the mouth and surprisingly elegant on the finish.","124419":"Concentrated and intense, this wine features a potent whack of oak on the nose, with dark fruit and mocha overtones. There are enough hints of bright, raspberry-tinged fruit to warrant optimism about its aging trajectory, but at the moment it is dark, heavy and slightly scorched. Try after 2017.","124489":"For Roussanne, this is surprisingly neutral on the nose. It's marginally more expressive on the palate, where it offers hints of paraffin and toasted marshmallow. Still, it's plump and mouthfilling, with an attractive hint of ginger on the long finish.","124500":"Five different grape varieties go into this blend, including a surprising 8% Pinot Noir. There's a touch of grilled tomato upfront, followed by more traditional flavors of cassis, vanilla and chocolate. This medium- to full-bodied wine is open knit and ready to drink now.","124510":"This is the best example of this wine I can remember, as it manages to toe the fine line between being boldly aromatic and going over the top. Nettles and grapefruit, hints of white currants and passion fruit, it has something to offer any Sauvignon Blanc lover, finishing long and fresh.","124520":"A bit developed already, with a round mouthfeel and some honey character accented by citrus and gingery-peppery spice. Pleasant to drink now, but seems to lack the vivacity for extended aging.","124702":"This international venture based out of the former Nepenthe winery in the Adelaide Hills sources fruit from a number of vineyards in South Australia. This bottling is light on its feet for its 15% stated abv, showcasing fresh cherry fruit, gentle herbal notes and silky tannins. Drink now\u20132022.","124748":"Despite being unoaked, this is a weighty wine, with a thick, viscous texture and simple, tangy flavors of canned pineapple. Drink it well chilled.","124787":"Possessing bold waves of pineappley fruit, this is an intensely flavored Chardonnay at a reasonable price. It's fruity and direct, with clean citrus featuring prominently from start to finish.","124791":"Barrel fermented in older oak, but this wine is still marked by oak and lees, with a slightly toasty, custardy edge to the melon and nectarine aromas and flavors. This medium-bodied Viognier then picks up hints of coffee and chocolate on the finish. Drink now.","124969":"Seemingly fully mature, this wine features lots of savory, meaty notes to go along with dried fruit aromas, then adds brighter, tart berry flavors on the palate. Vanilla, tobacco and crisp acids seem to be taking control of the finish, so drink up before the fruit fades.","124971":"This unusual blend is 68% Shiraz and 32% Malbec, resulting in a full-bodied, deeply plummy wine. Hints of clove, pepper and earth impart welcome complexity on the nose, while the flavors fold in a black olive component. Softly tannic, so drink now or hold 2-3 years.","125072":"The Monster is approximately half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest a blend of Merlot (27%), Petit Verdot (12%) and Cabernet Franc (10%). Aromas and flavors are savory and slightly leathery, with a soft core of plum and cherry fruit, hints of cocoa and a long finish.","125127":"Suitably light in body and elegant, this is a pretty, varietally correct Pinot Noir, with fruity notes of cranberry and tart cherry accented by shadings of earth and brown sugar. It's silky on the finish, with delicate hints of coffee. Drink now.","125197":"The vineyard was planted in 1853, so these are some seriously old vines, yielding seriously concentrated fruit. The briary, blackberry fruit is lavished with toasty, vanilla-scented French oak, which melds nicely into a full-bodied, slightly creamy-textured wine that avoids any sensation of warmth or heaviness. Drink now\u20132030. Frederick Wildman & Sons","125277":"A solid example of Coonawarra Cabernet, the 2008 Terra Rossa features a charming combination of cherry-cassis fruit and eucalypt with cigar box and vanilla. It's medium to full in body, with fine balance and a long finish. Drink now\u20132016.","125436":"Like Spinal Tap, this wine turns the volume up to 11, packing in enough blueberry jam for breakfast on the Queen Mary II and enough cedary oak to build 100 saunas. It's undeniably powerful and intense, and embued with a lush, creamy texture; the only question is how it will evolve. Drink it now and stand your hair on end.","125444":"Fully mature, this flavorful, authentic-tasting Shiraz features scents of toast, molasses and vanilla, followed up by flavors of tobacco and cassis on the palate. It's a bit coarsely textured, but assertive and would pair well with roast beef or lamb.","125445":"The Dead Arm rarely wows this reviewer in our blind tastings, and while the 2007 is undeniably a very good wine, it shows a tart edge and a reined-in personality. Toast and vanilla frame cranberry and raspberry fruit, chocolate overtones and savory, meaty elements. Try it after 2015 and see if it has loosened up at all.","125449":"Intensely toasty on the nose, along with powerful menthol notes that persist from start to finish. This full-bodied, almost syrupy-concentrated Shiraz features plums and blackberries that take on a slightly medicinal cast, finishing on a fresh, resiny note. Try after 2016.","125450":"Dense and fudge-like in consistency, with aromas and flavors of mocha, molasses and marinated beef. It's as if the fruit has been cooked down into an intense reduction, with even the acids magnified into tartness on the finish. At 16.4% alcohol, this is probably a better match with the cheese course than with a main.","125515":"Tobacco, cassis and vanilla notes bring the aromas and flavors, while the wine's firm structure gives a medium-weight feel and dusty texture. Drink now\u20132025.","125516":"This is a pretty lean, tightly focused wine. Grilled pineapple and citrus notes broaden slightly on the midpalate, then come together again on the crisp, lemony finish. Drink now through the end of 2015.","125524":"In the context of 2010, I have to admit to some disappointment with how this wine is showing. It's still an excellent wine, filled with luscious oak and bold fruit. But the fruit is slightly stewed, the tannins slightly coarse and the wine's structure a bit open knit. At least in this vintage, it seems more short-term drinker than true collectible.","125590":"This medium-bodied Chardonnay kicks off with nutty notes of baked meringue layered over plump pear and melon fruit. There's a bit of toasted-grain as well, and a focused, lemony finish that lingers. Drink now\u20132019.","125655":"It's almost two-thirds Riesling, which gives the wine its tight focus and strong mineral and citrus overtones, but there's also Sauvignon Blanc, Marsanne, Viognier and Chardonnay in the mix, giving it layers of fruity complexity. Awfully good for the price.","126270":"This medium-bodied red is a bit obvious and confected, but delivers ample cassis fruit without any obvious structure to support it. It's jammy and a bit sweet-tasting on the finish.","126460":"Sourced from one of the world's oldest surviving vineyards (planted in 1843), this is a full-bodied, velvety-textured rendering of Barossa Shiraz. An ample dusting of licorice and baking spices add zest to ripe blackberry and plum fruit flavors, and the wine finishes long and lush, with a flash of vanilla. Drink now\u20132025+.","126653":"Full bodied and plush, with supple, velvety tannins that frame cassis fruit. At 60% Shiraz, it's mostly about the fruit, but the 30% Cabernet and 10% Merlot add herbal, tomato-like elements. Drink now\u20132018.","126909":"Ready to drink, this is a soft, rounded sparkler that offers plenty of toasted brioche flavor, with pineapple and honey coming through on the finish.","126983":"Starts off tight on the nose, offering up only struck flint and citrusy notes, but broadens out on the palate to reveal flavors of melon and white pepper. Citrus and spice linger nicely on the finish. Drink now.","127015":"Sourced from the Tarraford Vineyard (better known for its Chardonnay and Pinot Noir) this is a floral, aromatic wine. Notes of green peppercorns and pipe tobacco ease into raspberry fruit, made more complex through whole-bunch fermentation. The wine's silky texture is an added treat. This has the potential to be really interesting as it evolves through at least 2025.","127016":"Mint, black cherries and mocha aromas and flavors swirl together easily in this full-bodied Shiraz. It's burly without being overdone, the tannins coming together in a silky vein on the long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now\u20132030.","127078":"Hints of lemon curd and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e join peach and citrus, finishing with a surprising degree of elegance. Drink up.","127228":"A blend of Mount Barker and Margaret River fruit, this is lavishly oaked, chocolaty and rich, as decadent a bottle of Cabernet you'll find in Australia. Baking spices accent mocha and cassis in this full-bodied wine, which features a velvety texture and long finish. Drink 2020\u20132030, and possibly beyond.","127289":"A blend of two clones (MV6 and 114), this is a floral wine that blends ripe cherries with more savory notes of mushroom and smoke. The oak is wonderfully understated, which allows the fruit complexity to shine and leaves the fruit tannins to glide easily across the palate. Drink now\u20132025.","127295":"A blend of Grenache, Shiraz and Mourv\u00e8dre, this is much more firmly tannic and structured than most such Australian blends. Grilled meat, red plum, black tea and rose hip notes are crisp and firm on the palate. Drink 2015\u20132023, and possibly beyond that.","127598":"Starts off decently, with menthol-toast aromas of new oak layered over apple and lime fruit. Then turns overly oaky on the palate, blending caramel, toast and dill flavors with tart apple, finishing off with a slice of lemony acidity.","127600":"Aromas are musky and nutty at the same time, but also mix in some grapefruit notes. It tastes largely neutral, except for a dollop of baking spices that turn aggressively peppery on the lean finish.","127608":"No oak means that the pear and melon flavors are front and center in this slightly syrupy wine that finishes unexpectedly hard and tart, with metallic notes.","127611":"A decent introduction to Aussie Chardonnay, this new line from Penfolds boasts plenty of sweet vanilla and peach flavors in a full and somewhat syrupy package.","127613":"The warm climate of the Barossa is reflected in the heavy, sweet fruit flavors. The melon, guava and honey aromas and flavors lack zip and definition but certainly don't lack for ripeness.","127764":"It's a rare treat when a winery bottle-ages a wine for you, but that's exactly what's happened here. The result is a top-notch dry Aussie Riesling that's just entering its plateau of maturity, where it should stay for another 5\u201310 years. Slightly honeyed notes soften the intense scents of crushed stones, then pick up hints of tangerine on the palate. Replacing the briskness of youth is a soft, lingering finish.","127766":"Rocland puts out a number of inexpensive wines, but this is evidence that the company has quality aspirations as well. Filled with plum, blueberry, licorice and dried-spice notes, this is a reasonably full-bodied wine with a long, dusty finish that would pair nicely with steaks or roasts. Drink now\u20132018.","128182":"This medium-bodied wine boasts aromas reminiscent of trading-card bubble gum. Is that even still a thing? It's vaguely cherry-like, with hints of baby powder, yet completely dry and refreshing, with a crisp, clean finish. Drink now.","128265":"For a wine that's 100% Mourv\u00e8dre, this has pretty tame tannins, the suppleness and creamy texture helping to balance some of the crisp acids and tart red berry notes. Varietal cola and tree bark aromas and flavors add complexity to this structured but approachable red that should drink well for at least the next 5\u20138 years.","128279":"Savvy shoppers may be able to find this for about $20, making it an excellent deal in a full-bodied, structured red wine. Cassis, vanilla and plum notes mark the nose and palate, finishing with a flourish of dusty-textured tannins. Drink now\u20132025.","128434":"A remarkable effort, especially considering how difficult the 2011 vintage was in South Australia. Floral notes emerge on the nose, dressing up hints of raspberry compote, while the medium- to full-bodied palate delivers raspberries, cherries, cinnamon, clove and pepper. The tannins on the finish are fine and silky. Drink now\u20132025.","128983":"Of all the Clarendon Hills 2008 Syrahs, the Moritz probably offers the best value. It's plummy, dark and intense, with savory overtones of meat and spice that complement the wine's full body and creamy texture. The long finish echoes with hints of coffee, meat and plummy fruit. Drink now\u20132020.","129108":"This full-bodied, single-vineyard bottling has a distinct charred or roasted note to it, while the texture is slightly coarse. The flavors are earthy and dark, reminiscent of burnt wood and roasted meat, finally ending on an espresso note.","129120":"In the 2012 vintage, Cullen's entry-level red wine is an assemblage of 55% Merlot, 29% Malbec and 16% Petit Verdot. The result blends olive, berry and mocha notes into a medium-bodied red wine, with a touch of creaminess to its midpalate and a mouthwatering finish.","129211":"This is truly prickly, with a slight spritz of CO2 acting to perk up the lime, green apple and pineapple aromas and flavors. It's at the same time plump and off dry, deftly balancing sweetness and zest. Drink now. Old Bridge Cellars.","129233":"Gen Yers and Baby Boomers will remember when Rosemount's ubiquitous Diamond Label wines represented great value. This Cab offers slightly confected cherry fruit, a whisper of mint and hints of vanilla. It's round in the mouth without being heavy, a fresh fruity wine for immediate gratification.","129370":"This wine shows much less oak influence than Pepik's Zdar bottling, but in this case that's a good thing. The fruit is herbal and perhaps a bit tomatoey, but there's enough cherry to hold things together, with smoke and sous-bois notes for complexity. It's a light- to medium-bodied wine that finishes on a crisp note. Drink now.","129407":"This medium-bodied Pinot features aromas of vanilla, beet greens and a touch of cola to go with extremely soft tannins. Flavors of cola, cedar and earth end on hints of tart berries and coffee.","129726":"Hints of buttered toast and roasted nuts mark the nose of this medium-bodied wine. It's plump on the palate, blending cinnamon, clove and cashew notes with melon, peach and pineapple fruit, then comes to a close in more oak spice and some leesy richness."},"designation":{"78":"Made
