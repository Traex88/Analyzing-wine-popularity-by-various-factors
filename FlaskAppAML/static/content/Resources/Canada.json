At 250 g\/L of residual sugar, it's dense and rich with carmelized sugar flavors and a lengthy finish.","2640":"A slightly earthy, spicy nose leads, followed up by good acidity and a touch of flowers. Pair with a cheese plate or enjoy on its own. Imported by Wine Emporium.","5615":"Intense flavors of mango, melon and apricot lead on this lively but rich dessert. The palate is bursting with flavor but layered spice softens and adds depth. The sweetness is enhanced by a pretty floral character that lingers through the finish. Imported by Wine Emporium.","5695":"Sourced from a single vineyard on Oliver's North Bench, this was fermented and aged in one-quarter new French oak barrels. The time in oak has somewhat muted the snappy vitality of the fruit (some tasters might argue it has simply rounded it off). Grassy hints of fresh asparagus remain, and with peppery herb, juicy gooseberry and citrus peel.","7556":"This irresistible, lightly frizzante and utterly refreshing wine is a gem. Orange flesh and rind has a slightly candied potency, with outstanding purity, focus and length. In spite of the sweetness, it retains offsetting minerality and acidity, making it a perfect ap\u00e9ritif or brunch wine.","7565":"Produced from the estate vineyard's oldest vines, this CSV bottling is a dry, leesy, textural wine, with dominant flavors of citrus flesh and rind along with green apples. There's a strong streak of mineral also, and a well-balanced finish of medium length.","7672":"This off-dry wine is solid, with a mix of lemons and oranges in a broad, fruity midpalate. A thick streak of sweet tea comes up also, and the wine, though blocky and one-dimensional, is quite nice chilled down as an ap\u00e9ritif.","7676":"This is quite light, with berry fruit running into tongue-scraping tannins. Flavors of earth and stem add still more grip and herbaceous character, outstripping the mild fruit.","7829":"Essentially a Bordeaux-style blend (just 4% Syrah breaks the mold), this smooth, silky wine is seductive. The blueberry, black cherry and plum fruit has compelling complexity, further enhanced with flavors of coffee and toast from 14 months in French oak.","7852":"This unique, port-style dessert wine fortifies its Marechal Foch, Cabernet Franc and Merlot base with walnut brandy. Smooth as silk, it has clearly benefitted from extra bottle age, and drinks like a dream. It's loaded with lush and generous flavors of cr\u00e8me de cassis, toffee, coffee, maple syrup and caramel.","7930":"Smooth as silk and deeply concentrated, this outstanding icewine offers pressed apple, peach, pear, apricot and papaya fruit in a seamless, dense and immensely flavorful core. A streak of butter and honey carries it into a long, splendid finish.","8198":"This snappy blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier, S\u00e9millon and Muscat brings a pungent, somewhat grassy profile front and center. Stone fruits with a touch of lime fill in the core, with some bite to the finish.","8280":"This wine is the vinous equivalent of biting into a ripe, juicy mango that has been drizzled with honey. It's viscous and full in feel, loaded with tropical flavors that linger on the finish. Perhaps a bit one note but represents it well.","8284":"Harvested at 40.16 Brix and retaining a whopping 255 g\/L residual sugar, this wine shows a complex medley of notes ranging from fresh baked apple pie to apricot and cinnamon. It's thick and rich in feel with stone fruit and dried orange rind flavors persisting through the long-drawn-out finish.","10065":"This vibrantly aromatic wine brings generous notes of honey, pineapple, papaya and apricot. It's intensely sweet and rich in flavor and feel, lingering on the finish.","10753":"This wine feels flat, with no life to the palate. It's been fermented to complete dryness, leaving only tired skin flavors of dried lemon and mixed citrus. Two bottles were tasted, with identical results.","10776":"This is the winery's superstar Bordeaux-style blend, and one of the defining red wines of the Okanagan. In its youth it is peppery, tannic and tough, with strong herbal flavors, along with pomegranate, cranberry and white raspberry fruit. It's firmly acidic, lightly toasty, complex and finished with flavors of coffee grounds, cacao, baking spices and smoke. Drink now through 2025.","10788":"Dark and silky, this bursts open with ripe plum and black cherry fruit. Streaks of smoke and iron run through, along with highlights of bright citrus. Sweet toast and dark chocolate flavors wrap up a long and most satisfying finish. Drink now through 2024.","10801":"Tart berry and sour cherry fruit is set amidst a well-balanced, pure varietal expression of Cab Franc. A touch of stem, earth and coffee carry out the varietal flavors, with a firmness to the tannins.","10852":"A very pretty wine with a refined aroma profile of wild strawberry, wet stone, dried cherry and peppery spice backed by rich, candied fruit flavors that manage retain deftness.","10853":"Lightly aromatic with notes of currant, cranberry and spice. The palate is all about balance, with sugary fruit flavors that are drawn out in the finish.","10953":"This southern Rh\u00f4ne-style blend is soft, lush and heavy with a rich mix of peach, apricot and papaya fruit power. One-third new oak barrels put a patina of toast and butterscotch on the ripe fruit, with a finishing flavor of fresh roasted cashews.","12195":"Oculus is 71% Merlot, with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and 13% Cabernet Franc finishing the blend. As with Mission Hill's other high-end red blends, it's almost jet black in hue, with scents of smoke and char around blackberry and black cherry fruit. Chocolate and espresso flavors come through strongly, and the tannins are quite drying. It's a style ready-made for a thick, juicy steak.","12321":"A bit closed at first, then swirling, characteristic Riesling aromas of pears, golden delicious apples and superripe peaches appear. Thick and intense, it's almost overwhelming in its honeyed richness. Sweet enough to pair with many desserts, but try it with blue-veined cheeses for a special treat.","13117":"Elegant and polished, this brings raspberry pastry flavors, a touch of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and scents of light toast to a wine with impressive length. It was fermented with wild yeasts and aged 18 months in 25% new French oak.","13700":"Pure varietal, this spent 18 months in French oak. Dried cherries, plums and tobacco combine, at first quite tight and compact, but eventually opening into a full-bodied and flavorful red. A touch of maple syrup from the barrel aging sweetens the tannins and enlivens the finish.","14665":"The smoky, spicy aromatics lead into an intriguing Bordeaux-style blend that is dominated by Merlot (70%). Well-defined, dense and balanced, its flavors are stacked vertically, supple and tight, with berry, cherry, plum and chocolate interwoven. Tannins are firm and smooth. Drink now through 2025.","15336":"Sourced from a single vineyard on Oliver's North Bench, this was fermented and aged in one-quarter new French oak barrels. The time in oak has somewhat muted the snappy vitality of the fruit (some tasters might argue it has simply rounded it off). Grassy hints of fresh asparagus remain, and with peppery herb, juicy gooseberry and citrus peel.","17137":"Produced from the estate vineyard's oldest vines, this CSV bottling is a dry, leesy, textural wine, with dominant flavors of citrus flesh and rind along with green apples. There's a strong streak of mineral also, and a well-balanced finish of medium length.","17893":"Smells oily, with a diesel-fuel note that some may find offputting. Rich and earthy on the palate, this bottling emphasizes spice, mineral and loam flavors, not the bright fruit of so many other Ontario products.","18815":"Calliope is the second label of Burrowing Owl. This tight, toasty blend is comprised of 56% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc, 8% Malbec and 6% Syrah. Pinpoint fruit flavors of plum and cherry carry a pleasant saline note.","18912":"Tannic and astringent at first taste, this wine opens up into a more complex and interesting play of dark fruits and darker flavors. Smoke, earth, char and espresso components are set against tight blueberry fruit, with lead pencil tannins. Those tannins might need a juicy steak to put them back in their cage.","19435":"Tannic and astringent at first taste, this wine opens up into a more complex and interesting play of dark fruits and darker flavors. Smoke, earth, char and espresso components are set against tight blueberry fruit, with lead pencil tannins. Those tannins might need a juicy steak to put them back in their cage.","20362":"Produced from late-picked grapes, this 100% varietal concentrates perfumed scents and flavors into a wine that is almost syrupy. The score reflects a slightly bitter flavor that comes up in the finish and lingers stubbornly through the next sip.","20376":"This special-edition wine carries a striking logo relating to a particular chair that has something to do with the owners. Apart from that, it's pretty standard stuff\u2014black cherry, plum and cocoa flavors with a definite green edge. It finishes tannic and chewy with a bit of alcoholic heat.","20677":"This has an edge, a frame of herb and skin flavors that tightens the mouthfeel. Green pineapple, cilantro, cucumber and lemon verbena are in play, with a penetrating attack and a pleasantly soft finish. The wine has a density that somehow recalls extra-virgin olive oil.","20695":"A whiff of earth under tangy, young, grapy fruit leads into a tasty, easy-drinking Gamay with flavors of mountain berries. Firm, lemony acidity underscores the bright fruit. Drink this over the next couple of years while the freshness remains.","21454":"It's no surprise that excellent icewine is being made in the Niagara region of Canada, but this Vidal offering from Jackson-Triggs is a pleasure nonetheless. With its layered aromas and flavors of orange, apricot and honey lifted by crisp acidity, this is both approachable and collectible. A serious wine with a fun and flirty side. Imported by Icon Estates.","21735":"Aromas of apricot, honey and vanilla give this dessert wine a luscious start. On the palate, balanced, creamy flavors of citrus, fruit and honey linger. Full but not cloying, the wine will pair well with creamy cheeses.","22983":"A somewhat reserved wine but one that still shows some complexity with notes of honey, apricot, lychee and smoky spice. The palate is rich and luscious with good length and a spice-filled finish.","26242":"The Vidal Gold Icewine starts with an enticing nose of tropical fruit, honey and spice. Mouthfilling, intense flavors of peach, mango and apricot follow, balanced by crisp acidity. Clean but complex, the wine unfolds extravagantly on the palate. The wine can age and will intensify as time passes.","27602":"Portfolio is a full-on, five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend\u2014half Merlot. Dark, dense and textural, it's loaded with blackberry and black cherry fruit, swathed in baking spices, cinnamon and mocha. The tannins are beautifully managed, and it should drink magnificently through the mid-2020s.","27658":"Wow, is this sweet\u2014tooth-achingly sweet. The aromas and flavors are relatively pure and free of botrytis; instead you get boatloads of ripe pear and melon flavors, huge thickness and weight, and decent acidity. Almost too rich and sweet for its own good.","27670":"Vidal has a peculiar bouquet that I have a hard time describing. This one boasts muskmelon, litchi and kumquat aromas, backed by a honeyed sweetness and grapefruit-like acids. Intense\u2014verging on overblown\u2014this is a fine example of what this French-American hybrid is capable of producing.","29433":"Lovely, dense aromas of dried flowers, herbs, cherries and chocolate immediately capture attention. This is a superbly elegant wine, with both precision and power. Orange-peel flavors highlight deep cherry compote, with tension, balance and length in abundance.","29798":"Tawny copper in color, this starts out with a bit of spice that quickly disappears. It's thin without any fruit flavor at all, and finishes with a hint of plastic.","29988":"Elegant and detailed, this is a dry, racy wine with well-balanced flavors of lemon, lime, citrus and mineral. It's quite fresh and perfectly proportioned, with exceptional length. Delicious already, it can easily age until 2025 and probably well beyond.","32309":"A thoroughly dazzling wine that brings focused, complex notes of honey, pineapple and dried apricot. At 266 g\/L residual sugar, it's thick, rich and luscious, with the grape's natural acidity carrying the flavors through to a long, lively and lingering finish.","35718":"Dark and silky, this bursts open with ripe plum and black cherry fruit. Streaks of smoke and iron run through, along with highlights of bright citrus. Sweet toast and dark chocolate flavors wrap up a long and most satisfying finish. Drink now through 2024.","35726":"This is the winery's superstar Bordeaux-style blend, and one of the defining red wines of the Okanagan. In its youth it is peppery, tannic and tough, with strong herbal flavors, along with pomegranate, cranberry and white raspberry fruit. It's firmly acidic, lightly toasty, complex and finished with flavors of coffee grounds, cacao, baking spices and smoke. Drink now through 2025.","38019":"Steely and compact, this rather reluctantly opens to reveal subtle complexity. The mix of tart blueberry and blackberry fruit is accompanied by scents of cured meat, menthol and garrigue. It spent 18 months in a mix of barrels and puncheons, yielding a pleasant finishing impression of cedar. Decant this for at least an hour or two.","38082":"This Bordeaux-style blend is 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Cabernet Franc, 20% Merlot, 6% Malbec (new this vintage) and 3% Petit Verdot. Carrying a whiff of musty leather, it nonetheless impresses with mixed black berries, a hint of cigar and polished, firm, substantial tannins. It's a fine steak wine to enjoy now through 2022.","38083":"Aromas of buttered nuts sail forth, and turn into strong flavors set against stone fruits and skins. Details from barrel aging add nuances of spice and coconut to this tasty wine.","38249":"This 100% varietal cuv\u00e9e is smoky, supple and detailed. From the first sniff, what comes to mind is spice-rubbed grilled venison. In the glass it's fresh and full, with blackberry and loganberry jam. The freshness, tension and balance are pitch-perfect.","40174":"This is quite light, with berry fruit running into tongue-scraping tannins. Flavors of earth and stem add still more grip and herbaceous character, outstripping the mild fruit.","41232":"This easy-drinking Canadian Gew\u00fcrz leads with aromas of pear, allspice and lychee. Medium-bodied, its cheerful fresh fruit sweetness is balanced by a refreshing zip and energetic spice. Lively but with some weight. Pair with Indian cuisine, sushi.","42690":"A sniff of truffle introduces this light but interesting wine. It's still youthful and tight, with tart fruit conjuring up sour cherry pie. Another couple of years in the bottle would put the optimal drinking between 2018 and 2020.","43467":"This wine still appears to be coming out of its shell, showing some reduction with reticent notes of red plum, cherry and berry. The flavors are lipsmacking and rich, but it's difficult right now to get a clear sense of where it's all going.","49059":"This tastes quite dry, though the residual sugar comes in at 12 g\/L, enough to tilt some Rieslings toward off dry. The fruit is a bit thin, with flavors of celery and white peach. The mouthfeel is refreshing, with wet stone minerality and plenty of tart acids.","49060":"Though it was picked at 29 brix and fermentation stopped with 87 g\/L residual sugar, this carries a bitter streak all through the palate. The sweetness shows as a burst of caramel apple.","49883":"One hundred percent Cabernet Franc, this wine shows subtle, nuanced aromas of fresh strawberry, cherry and wildflowers. The palate is compact with a tight core of sweet fruit flavors.","51458":"Aged 10 months in 25% new American oak, this pleasantly oaky wine delights with its complexity and overall balance. Pineapple, peach and citrus fruits are complemented by notes of coconut (there's that American oak) and hazelnut. Firm acids bring further citrus highlights to the finish.","51835":"Cherry and plum, chocolate and peppery herbs combine here in a well-structured wine with some years of life ahead. Aged in one-third new French oak for 11 months, it will reward decanting or aeration if you are drinking it in the next year or two.","52047":"Made from 100% Cabernet Franc, this dry wine does not entirely skirt the challenges that the grape poses for ros\u00e9. Tart and stiff, it mostly tastes of underripe rhubarb, green herb and citrus. Best drunk with food, perhaps roast chicken.","52677":"The impenetrably obscure label design makes this difficult to find, but once your hands are on the bottle, it's smooth sailing. A \u201csecond label\u201d Bordeaux-style blend, this delicious, fruity and distinctive wine puts a wrap of tangy citrus around black cherry, coffee and licorice components. Malbec is the principal grape, with smaller amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc.","53313":"Pure varietal, this is a relatively light take on Syrah, but balanced and showing some nice details of tobacco and licorice. The fruit is tart\u2014a mix of rhubarb and tangy red berry\u2014and there's ample acidity for those who like their reds to snap into focus.","53328":"This is 48% Cabernet Sauvignon and 52% Syrah, which seems to be the dominant grape in terms of flavor and style. Scents and flavors of char, licorice and espresso come up quickly, with black fruit showing a peppery edge. The finish seems attenuated, even with ample aeration.","54135":"This is a dry-style Riesling, though it still lends a ripe, fruity impression. Lemon, lime and grapefruit are shuffled into a winning hand, with ample details of cilantro, fennel and wet stone. It's a vibrant, refreshing wine that is immensely food friendly.","56293":"Hailing from the winery's Cave Spring Vineyard, it's dry in style with notes of notes of lime, slat, and mint backed by tart, mouthwatering acids that draw out the finish.","56928":"A very aromatic wine, showing notes of orange marmalade, brown sugar and apricot. It's supremely rich, with a mango and honey filled finish.","63477":"There is a refreshing minerality underscoring this tightly wound wine. Fruit flavors of grapefruit, lime and white melon carry a hint of spice. There's penetrating acidity, only slightly muted by the 13 g\/L of residual sugar.","63989":"The Charmat process, rather than the Champagne method, is used here. It's a clean, light, generic sparkling wine, done as a brut. Use it as an all-purpose mixer for best effect.","66039":"This is an intriguing red, with its nose of dried fennel, eucalyptus, and rosemary, and on the palate, pretty flavors of cassis and anise. Though gentle, the wine has balance and character. Imported by Wine Emporium.","69150":"A second-label for Black Hills Estate Winery, this little gem overdelivers in every regard. Exceptionally fragrant, it's a m\u00e9lange of floral, spice, mint and citrus aromas, cascading into a fruit-driven palate. Lemon, lime, apricot and papaya combine to provide a lush and vibrant set of flavors. Drink up while the freshness is in full force.","69152":"This straight-on wine powers through with clean apple and peach fruit, wrapped in a blanket of barrel toast. Full-flavored and crisp, it does not show much complexity, but plenty of toasty goodness.","69600":"This is a solid, complex, complete and evocative five-grape Bordeaux blend. It has distinctive characteristics reflective of the region's terroir. Threads of soy and balsamic run across deep cassis fruit. The stiff acidity has a citrus flavor, and details of clean fresh herb add further interest. It's a wine with a fine sense of detail, balance and length.","70505":"A delightful bottle with notes of stone fruit, buttered popcorn and toasty spice. It's light in style, displaying both nuance and delicacy, with enough acidity to keep it all in vivid focus.","71257":"This Bordeaux-style blend comprises 68% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc and a splash each of Malbec and Petit Verdot. The massive tannins dominate, to the detriment of balance and fruit. Perhaps those tannins will mellow with ample age, but that's a ways off. Right now it offers hints of plum and cherry, a dash of mocha, and a lot of stem and earthy tannins.","71984":"This Bordeaux-style blend is 28% Merlot, 28% Cabernet Franc, 41% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% Petit Verdot. Sweet scents of cracker open into a wine with pretty red plum and details of coffee and chocolate. It does not in any way reflect the rather high-listed alcohol, but seems more elegant and lightly refined.","73735":"Golden raisins, poached pear, caramel and butterscotch meld together in this low alcohol, intensely flavored icewine. The flavors expand to include candied pineapple, with tremendous viscosity and enough acidity to keep it aloft and penetrating.","73751":"With its intense scents and flavors of orange candy, Muscat is often made in a sweet style, but here it shows its dry side, and to good effect. Bright and penetrating scents and flavors hit on the entire spectrum of oranges, with excellent weight, precision and concentration. A touch of candied ginger adds further interest.","74112":"The aromas and flavors of tangerine, ripe pineapple, jasmine and honey are all robust on a wine that is more about subtlety and elegance than sheer weight and volume. It's very well balanced with an extremely long finish.","74113":"Harvested on January 3rd at a ripe 37.8 Brix, it brings an aromatic explosion of dried apricot, citrus, honey, apple and pear. It's full bodied, rich and luscious with well balanced acidity drawing out the finish.","76793":"The low-yielding vines average 35 years of age, and their flavors are subtle yet distinctive. This wine unfolds slowly and almost imperceptibly, with subtle minerality around flavors of citrus pith and rind. It's tart and racy, with a lick of Key lime through the finish.","76807":"Lush and lovely, this sweet treat is an outstanding example of the variety made as an icewine. Loaded with apricot, tangerine, peach and honey, it compensates for its sweetness with balancing acidity. One 375 ml bottle will easily serve four for dessert.","77627":"Full barrel fermentation in French oak yields a delicious Chardonnay with fruit tasting of grapefruit and peaches. The buttery mouthfeel and streak of vanilla cookie match up well with the expected acidity from Okanagan grapes.","84829":"Scents of leather, coffee and a hint of barnyard emerge, adding some interesting funk to the fruit flavors of tart, wild berries. Barrel aging adds notes of cocoa and cedar on the finish.","85473":"This is just the second vintage for this winery, whose inviting labels look like handwritten notes. The ros\u00e9 captures the bright color, fresh fruit and silky texture of its Pinot Noir grape; it's a perfect salmon or turkey wine, and one you could happily sip as an ap\u00e9ritif.","88192":"This comes in at 15g\/L residual sugar, but it's more than offset with mineral-drenched acidity, so it drinks like a dry wine. Pale lemon in hue, it offers citrus flesh and rind in a young, yeasty, medium-bodied wine. The persistent, crisply-defined finish leaves a pleasing aftertaste of tangerine.","88996":"This Bordeaux-style blend is comprised of 44% Cabernet Sauvignon, 43% Merlot and 13% Cabernet Franc. The fruit flavors of raspberry and blackberry are light and tangy, the tannins mellow. A note of dark chocolate highlights the finish.","89278":"Pinot Noir from Canada can often be quite delicate, but this is a full-bodied, even muscular effort. Toasty and tasty, it puts a pleasant roasted character upon ripe strawberry and cherry fruit. Tannins are substantial, along with some barrel flavors from nine months in French oak.","89549":"Made from 100% Cabernet Franc, this dry wine does not entirely skirt the challenges that the grape poses for ros\u00e9. Tart and stiff, it mostly tastes of underripe rhubarb, green herb and citrus. Best drunk with food, perhaps roast chicken.","89726":"This Bordeaux-style blend comprises 60% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and a smattering of three other grapes. There's an herbal frame around dark cassis fruit and a powdery mouthfeel from stiff, dry tannins. The accents of char, graphite and smoke are well integrated.","91586":"Though pale in color, this is a tannic and flavorful wine with an earthy underpinning. Lightly spiced red-fruit flavors unfold and gather strength midpalate. This nicely captures the elegance of Naramata Bench Pinot Noir.","91590":"There is a refreshing minerality underscoring this tightly wound wine. Fruit flavors of grapefruit, lime and white melon carry a hint of spice. There's penetrating acidity, only slightly muted by the 13 g\/L of residual sugar.","91996":"A very pretty, very varietal wine with notes of strawberry, cherry and jalapeno pepper. The palate is full of luscious, candied red fruit flavors that lead to a spice-filled finish.","92291":"A full five years old but still with a long life ahead of it, this wine is in full blossom with notes of petrol, slate and white flowers. Harvested at 38.3 Brix and retaining 222 g\/L of residual sugar, it's full of concentrated, rich apricot flavors that linger after each sip for close to a minute.","92301":"Richly aromatic, with notes of orange marmalade, apricot, honey and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. It's thick and creamy in feel while still displaying exceptional balance, length and intensity.","95220":"Rich and creamy, this barrel-fermented (in neutral oak) wine has appealing flavors of pear tart, grapefruit and coconut cream pie. The bracing acids compensate for all the lush creamy flavor, and the result is darn near irresistible.","95356":"A uniquely styled wine with notes of apple cider and caramel. It's rich and creamy with a panoply of fruit flavors that come in waves and linger long after the last sip. Offers as much in feel as it does in flavor.","95380":"A direct and appealing wine, with notes of wild strawberry, wet stone, cherry and cranberry. It's fruity and concentrated while still retaining lightness of expression. Drawn out fruit flavors linger on the finish.","95774":"With over 80 apples used to produce each bottle, there's no question as to what the dominating fruit character is here. Aromas of apple skins, clove and ginger on the nose transition to flavors of candied apple, white grape and honeyed apricot in the sticky, viscous mouth. Long and lingering on the finish; a dessert wine sure to please those with a sweet tooth.","96663":"A real oddball that's musky, melony, sweet and\u2013yes\u2013bubbly. Vidal is a French-American hybrid with some strange petrolly aromatics that take some getting used to, and they're well-displayed in this example that gets its bubbles from fermentation in sealed tanks, trapping the naturally occurring carbon dioxide.","96935":"The gold capsule Oldfield Series wines occupy a sort of reserve tier. This is principally a blend of Chardonnay, S\u00e9millon and Sauvignon Blanc, with a splash of Viognier and Muscat adding aromatic highlights. Snappy citrus fruit and a light dusting of cinnamon makes this well-crafted wine a versatile, refreshing option for a variety of seafood and salad entr\u00e9es.","97012":"Lean and yeasty, this light-fruited effort seems almost beer-like. The hoppy flavors are fresh and palate-cleansing, the flavors very lightly suggesting green apples and citrus.","97214":"This Bordeaux-style blend is 28% Merlot, 28% Cabernet Franc, 41% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% Petit Verdot. Sweet scents of cracker open into a wine with pretty red plum and details of coffee and chocolate. It does not in any way reflect the rather high-listed alcohol, but seems more elegant and lightly refined.","97286":"Fragrant, with a floral lift in the nose, this is loaded with rich fruit flavors of pineapple, peach and citrus. A whiff of toast and just-sawn wood leads into a lengthy, beautifully balanced, tongue-coating finish.","97639":"Harvested at 40.16 Brix and retaining a whopping 255 g\/L residual sugar, this wine shows a complex medley of notes ranging from fresh baked apple pie to apricot and cinnamon. It's thick and rich in feel with stone fruit and dried orange rind flavors persisting through the long-drawn-out finish.","97646":"Medium cherry in color with notes of raspberry jam, wet stone, mint and cherry. This wine is viscous in mouthfeel with sweet, focused fruit flavors that almost reach excessive but pull back just in time.","97661":"Aged for four months in oak, this wine brings an explosion of complex aromas of tangerine, dried apricot, honey and a speckling of smoky oak spices. The palate is full, rich and luscious, with concentrated stone fruit flavors that linger long after the last sip.","97664":"A uniquely styled wine with notes of apple cider and caramel. It's rich and creamy with a panoply of fruit flavors that come in waves and linger long after the last sip. Offers as much in feel as it does in flavor.","98273":"This has an edge, a frame of herb and skin flavors that tightens the mouthfeel. Green pineapple, cilantro, cucumber and lemon verbena are in play, with a penetrating attack and a pleasantly soft finish. The wine has a density that somehow recalls extra-virgin olive oil.","99162":"Inniskillin continues to push the boundaries of icewine, as evidenced by this wood-aged Vidal. The vanilla and spice of oak barrels partially masks some of the stranger Vidal aromas, allowing the apricot and peach scents to come to the fore. There are some creamy lactic notes on the finish that detract slightly, but this is a very good effort at an entirely different genre.","99164":"Shows ample evidence of botrytis on the apricot-scented nose, with less-dominant aromas of ultraripe pears and peaches blending in. It's very juicy and fruity, with some lime-like acidity that keeps it fresh. Best with fresh fruits, or try with a foie gras appetizer.","99223":"Partially (35%) fermented in French oak, this is a soft, round and fruity wine. Lightly toasted with scents of coconut and camphor, it's still packed with crisp lime and gooseberry fruit, providing a solid underpinning.","99526":"Perhaps a little overripe on the nose, this late harvest is high-toned and rather sharp in its attack. Concentrated peach, apricot, butter brickle and honey flavors carry the midpalate, but the finish turns bitter.","100523":"This off-dry Riesling has a nose of flowers and warming spices, followed by slightly sweet and spicy fruit (apples, pears, vanilla) flavors. The wine is simple but appealing.","100906":"Though it's designated as reserve-level, and lists rather high alcohol, this seems thin, stemmy and green. The fruit is nearly invisible. The addition of 14% Cabernet Franc has not had any noticeable impact. Drink up.","103664":"Principally Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this dark and smoky wine from Black Hills Estate Winery brings exceptional complexity to a more budget-friendly blend. Generous streaks of soy, espresso, dark chocolate and smoke wrap around a cassis core. The roasted black fruits and continuing flavors of smoke, tar and tobacco create a wine with power and length.","104438":"This off-dry wine is solid, with a mix of lemons and oranges in a broad, fruity midpalate. A thick streak of sweet tea comes up also, and the wine, though blocky and one-dimensional, is quite nice chilled down as an ap\u00e9ritif.","105588":"Lush and lovely, this sweet treat is an outstanding example of the variety made as an icewine. Loaded with apricot, tangerine, peach and honey, it compensates for its sweetness with balancing acidity. One 375 ml bottle will easily serve four for dessert.","107735":"The complex aromatics, texture and detail on display here may dazzle you. It's a wine that deserves your attention, deceptively light in color and taste, yet penetrating, with a core of strawberry jam and a streak of caramel mocha running through the finish. Drink now through 2025.","108276":"Here is a splendid example of this variety, intensely spicy, with the characteristic scents and flavors of rose petals, lychee fruit and baby powder. It shows tremendous depth and precision, and could be cellared through 2020, but why wait?","109504":"Aromatically appealing in notes of sarsaparilla, barrel spice and cherry. This full-bodied Pinot brings pomegranate and plum flavors to the palate, showing some dryness from the tannins.","110145":"This wine exhibits all of the hallmarks of a good Bordeaux blend: balance with power, poise with spirit. Its gamy, spicy nose leads into elegant, supple layers of earthy spice, brooding fruit and a lingering finish. This wine can age but it's good right now. Imported by Sante Wines.","111028":"Peaches and pears, lemons and grapefruits come together in this harmonious late harvest wine that shows little evidence of botrytis. The high acidity gives it balance and makes it a great foil for fruit-garnished foie gras.","112278":"Precise and polished, this wine offers up a mix of fig, plum, black cherry, chocolate and caramel. A streak of graphite underscores the polished tannins. Good already, this can be cellared and enjoyed through 2028 and perhaps beyond.","113559":"A detailed wine, with notes of wet slate, apricot and pear alongside high toned spices. It drinks off dry, with ripe stone-fruit flavors balanced by crisp acidity, leading to a lingering finish.","114465":"This Bordeaux-style blend may strike those unfamiliar with Okanagan reds as tilting toward an astringent, tannic style, which many of these wines do. That said, it's complex and compelling, with an array of dried herbs, dried tobacco, dried fruits (cranberries and cherries) and dark chocolate. The granular tannins are ripe and supportive, with a finishing lick of espresso. It's best to decant this for a couple of hours before drinking.","115723":"A whiff of petrol introduces this bone-dry effort, continuing with flavors of citrus rind and tangerine. The piercing acidity will cut through any number of noodle dishes, white fish, or poultry, though on its own the wine seems to fade into a somewhat dilute finish.","115734":"Delicate flowers, honey and a touch of apricot typify this lovely dessert wine. On the palate, the flavors are set aloft by a touch of spice and acid. The character is serious but feminine, and the finish lingering, but clean.","115743":"Estate-grown, two-thirds Merlot and one-third Cabernet Franc, it's another wine from the Naramata Bench. It is almost impenetrable when first poured, inky and dense. Over a period of hours the tart and spicy red fruits emerge, along with the herbal, soy, smoke and olive flavors that often characterize Okanagan Bordeaux blends.","115750":"Author Heidi Noble (Menus From An Orchard Table) and her husband Michael Dinn make Joie, and all four releases are beautifully executed. This unusual blend includes Riesling, Gew\u00fcrz, Pinot Blanc, Kerner and Ehrenfelser, with a splash of unfermented grape juice \u201cin the spirit of Edelzwicker.\u201d It is intensely perfumed, oily and loaded with peach and citrus, with the acidity to offset the sweetness.","115893":"This five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend is more than half Merlot, fragrant and forward in both aroma and flavor. It's broadly displayed across the palate, with pretty cherry fruit, steely tannins, and lighter hints of nut skin, cacao and dried earth. The complexity and balance are impressive. Drink 2015\u20132030.","116693":"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay offers subtle layers of flavor, weaving hints of leafy green herb, lemon skin and oil, together with suggestions of white peach. It's structured for drinking now and through 2021, with an elegant frame and modest proportions.","117005":"Well along the aging curve, this feels a bit pushed, with divergent and strong flavors of cherry, plum, licorice, smoke and sweet toast. There's a lot going on, though little sense of the elegance that often typifies Pinot Noir, and the tannins have a rough, rustic quality.","117402":"Spicy, floral and with a touch of minerality, this is poised and layered. It's dense and honeyed on the palate but overall, has a balanced, attractive character. Imported by Bayfield Importing, Ltd.","117960":"Anise, blackberry and pepper on the nose and palate create an appealing Merlot that is nonetheless a touch acidic. Balance it with a rich meat stew or duck entr\u00e9e.","119241":"A splendid nose with rose petals, lychee and melon starts this off well, and it continues with expressive fruit and tongue-coating oiliness. It's clean and rich, dry and robust, and would be ideal with a moderately spicy Thai curry.","119255":"Tart berry and sour cherry fruit is set amidst a well-balanced, pure varietal expression of Cab Franc. A touch of stem, earth and coffee carry out the varietal flavors, with a firmness to the tannins.","119647":"The vines, over 30 years old, deliver layered, racy, detailed flavors. German in style, the wine is loaded with citrus rind, honeysuckle, peach and lemon, finishing with minerals and a lick of honey. Intense and tightly structured for aging.","119874":"Cherry and plum, chocolate and peppery herbs combine here in a well-structured wine with some years of life ahead. Aged in one-third new French oak for 11 months, it will reward decanting or aeration if you are drinking it in the next year or two.","120165":"A vibrantly aromatic wine, with notes of petrol, marmalade, citrus and flowers. It's rich and honeyed, with a lightly smoky, lingering finish.","120401":"Native yeast was used in this block selection, a big-boned, almost chunky wine with flavors of dried plums and sesame candy. It has a pleasantly oily mouthfeel, and a finishing lick of hazelnuts.","120656":"This wine has a dancing, delicate nature. Aromas of apricot and honey are followed by floral, apricot and honey flavors. Elegant and friendly with balanced sugar and acid.","121508":"A reserve-level Merlot, this is blended with 9% Cabernet Franc and 2% Syrah, then barrel-aged for 18 months in new, one- and two-year-old French oak barrels. Oaky, smoky, charred and tannic, it's a bit of a bruiser. But dig down and you'll find cassis, black cherry, coffee, cola, licorice and tar\u2014in short, a compelling range of dark flavors, all well-integrated. Drink soon.","121526":"This carries true-to-variety flavors of peppery blackberry fruit, here cloaked in coffee and toast from aging in 40% new French and American oak barrels. The lemony acids contribute to the overall balance and ageworthy structure.","122225":"Ample accents of baking spices and unusual rose petal highlights push this out of the ordinary range of the grape. The pretty blueberry fruit is somewhat masked by all the sweet spice, but this delivers plenty of pleasing flavors.","123036":"Although this wine is described as slightly off dry by the winery, for most palates it would be perfectly dry, though just slightly rounded off to eliminate any suggestion of sourness. Lychee, pineapple and grapefruit flavors abound, underscored with refreshing minerality. That vivid acidity carries through a resonant, lively finish.","123988":"A very pretty, very varietal wine with notes of strawberry, cherry and jalapeno pepper. The palate is full of luscious, candied red fruit flavors that lead to a spice-filled finish.","125520":"This southern Rh\u00f4ne-style blend is soft, lush and heavy with a rich mix of peach, apricot and papaya fruit power. One-third new oak barrels put a patina of toast and butterscotch on the ripe fruit, with a finishing flavor of fresh roasted cashews.","126567":"Rich and concentrated, this uber-reserve offers well-defined pear and lemon curd flavors, within a fresh pastry setting. The length and creamy texture is impressive. Drink now through 2020.","126569":"The aromatics are interesting but a bit deceptive, showing a rather salty, herbal scent suggesting green olives. Once tasted, the unctuous apricot and candied pineapple fruit takes over, with lime and quince as well. It's ready right now for immediate consumption.","126620":"Pinot Noir from Canada can often be quite delicate, but this is a full-bodied, even muscular effort. Toasty and tasty, it puts a pleasant roasted character upon ripe strawberry and cherry fruit. Tannins are substantial, along with some barrel flavors from nine months in French oak.","126939":"This unusual five-grape blend includes Chardonnay, S\u00e9millon, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier and Muscat. It maintains a sense of focus, with the grassy, herbal character of Sauv Blanc and S\u00e9millon commanding most of the attention. It's stiff, woody (rather than oaky) and herbal. Try it with fresh goat cheese.","127262":"This is a Merlot-dominant blend, with additions of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Sangiovese. At first tight, spicy and herbal, it then blossoms with dark, deep juicy black fruits. The finish is long and trim, bringing in more complexity, with coffee, cassis and espresso. Drink now through 2025.","127897":"The nose suggests truffle around compact cherry fruit. The wine is nicely balanced, relatively high in acid, and fashioned for elegance more than power. A finishing whiff of chocolate adds interest.","127906":"This blends Dijon clones 76 and 96, and is partially barrel fermented. The spicy nose sharpens the palate with pine needle aromas, and the flavors follow. It's a precise wine, showing pine and mineral more than fruit.","129055":"A brilliant blend of 61% Viognier, 21% Roussanne and 18% Marsanne, this impresses with its proportion, tension and balance. Scents and flavors meld citrus oil and rind, fruit flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and Meyer lemon, and a lovely finish with highlights of English breakfast tea. Long and elegant, this is a landmark effort.","129056":"From a vintage that pushes the fruit out in front, this is loaded with tart, tangy blackberry, boysenberry and huckleberry flavors. At first stiff and compact, it blooms open to reveal streaks of sandalwood, sassafras, iron filings and clean earth. It's a high-wire wine with aging potential at least until 2030.","129487":"A youthful and appealing wine with notes of orange peel, citrus and crushed flowers. The palate brings abundant stone fruit flavors that taper off toward the finish.","129529":"A delicious though somewhat reserved wine with notes of lychee, honey, sugared pineapple and mint.
