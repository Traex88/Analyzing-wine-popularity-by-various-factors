balsamic vinegar and cheesy oak aromas feed into a palate that's braced by a bolt of acidity. A compact set of saucy red-berry and plum flavors features tobacco and peppery accents, while the finish is mildly green in flavor, with respectable weight and balance.","17":"Raw black-cherry aromas are direct and simple but good. This has a juicy feel that thickens over time, with oak character and extract becoming more apparent. A flavor profile driven by dark-berry fruits and smoldering oak finishes meaty but hot.","229":"Blackberry and road-tar aromas are dark and stout. This is moderately tannic and a bit rough and jagged on the palate. Flavors of stewed black plum and prune are ripe almost to an extreme, and that's how it finishes as well.","251":"Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon.","258":"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish.","271":"For an under-$15 red blend, Corte has it going on. It's rich and full, almost syrupy on the nose, with lots of oak, ink and vanilla. Shows power and packs a punch, with dark berry, chocolate and spicy flavors. A little tannic and scratchy, but with structure and framework to spare. Malbec (80%), with Bonarda and Petit Verdot.","278":"Leather, berry, earth, raisin and roasted qualities define the nose on this Tempranillo-led blend of four grapes. Feels good in the mouth, with active raspberry, plum and coffee flavors that comes with a roasted accent. Mildly leafy, baked and woody on the thorough finish.","280":"A medium-weight Cabernet with plum, prune, tobacco and herb aromas. Features average weight and body, with a creamy texture and layered flavors of black fruit, raspberry and spice. Finishes with herb and plum notes as well as a pinch of tobacco.","290":"This huge Malbec defines jammy and concentrated. The bouquet is ripe, soft and minty, while the palate echoes the nose with thickness and density. Flavors of prune, raisin, tea and blackberry are borderline syrupy, while the finish is smooth and pure but doesn't offer much spine or foundation. Drink this modern Malbec sooner rather than later.","300":"Deep, lush aromas of black fruits, graphite and coconut are welcoming and friendly. The mouthfeel is pure and smooth, with elegance and power. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, hard spices and licorice filter into a long, mellow, classy finish. This is a pushy, full-bodied wine that doesn't throw punches; drink through 2020.","561":"Smoky, charred aromas of blackberry and blackened spices set up a bold palate with energy to spare. Blackberry and cassis flavors are rich, toasty and chocolaty, while the finish on this full-bodied, ripe Malbec is lengthy and moderately complex. Drink through 2021.","575":"Smoky and intense from the get-go, this saturated, black-as-night Malbec is full of blackberry, cassis and gamy aromas. While it goes heavy on the gas, the wine's structure is up to it. Flavors of chocolate, burnt toast, salt and blackberry finish toasty and long, with savory blackened spice notes. Drink through 2023.","614":"Mild berry and cherry aromas are standard and slightly oaky. The palate on this blend of Malbec, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is choppy and tannic, while earthy flavors of cherry and plum are pushed by firm acids. This finishes tannic, with coffee and herbal flavors.","725":"Sweet oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a jammy bouquet that also features black plum and blackberry scents. This blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat feels full, lifted and balanced. Ripe, enticing flavors of wild berry and cassis are backed by toast, chocolate, vanilla and coconut notes as well as heat and burn. Drink through 2019.","738":"Initial aromas of lychee and jasmine are varietally correct but this struggles to stay fresh and instead turns oily on the nose. A mid-level palate holds nectarine, lychee and oily flavors that turn bitter on the finish.","746":"Oily, gritty aromas of almond skins set up a pungent but oily tasting palate. Core fruit flavors lean towards sour grapefruit and orange, while the finish is tangy, salty and sour through the last note.","749":"Roasted, stewed berry aromas are rustic and suggestive of grilled meat. This is high in acidity, and thus it feels sharp and edgy. Flavors of forced oak, related spice and tart plum end with a scraping, tannic feel and herbal berry flavors.","798":"Oaky, smoky aromas are New World all the way. Heavily toasted and creamy on the palate, this hefty full-bodied Chardonnay tastes of wood resin, spiced apple and peach. Solid acidity keep this in line, while a lasting wave of toasty oak pushes the finish.","922":"Flat in color, with a dull luster, this smells mulchy and earthy, with dampness to the nose. A thick, medicinal palate is dealing severe tannins embedded into a syrupy texture. Flavors of fig, raisin and earth are a little spent.","926":"Smashed berry aromas are backed by earth and toasty oak notes. Fairly hard and tannic on the palate, this shows herbal plum flavors in front of a bold finish with dry tannins and a hint of wood spice.","931":"Despite looking gold and mature, this PG exceeds expectations courtesy of waxy, baked-apple aromas and a full but balanced mouthfeel. Spiced apple, apricot and burnt orange flavors finish long due to core acidity. Drink immediately.","934":"Aromas of citrus and petrol are backed by a juicy palate with tangy acidity and semisharp flavors of peach, tangerine and stone-fruit pits. Fresh, citrusy length and a lingering note of orange are the finish.","938":"This Malbec is a collection of disparate parts that doesn't justify its price. Reduced plum and grapy berry aromas come with woodsy notes of menthol and cola. Highly herbal, saucy, savory flavors are more oaky than fruity, while this finishes with muscular tannins and savory, grapy notes.","942":"Roasted, woodsy, rubbery aromas are gamy and staunch, with berry notes interspersed. Grabby, rubbery tannins make for a rugged palate, while roasted plum and gamy flavors are a touch salty. A tannic finish doesn't change much.","998":"Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance. Compared to previous years, it's a little less generous but still a good way to go.","1034":"Warm, earthy, jammy berry aromas are oaky and bring a note of latex into the fold. This chunky Malbec is tannic and grabby, with oaky flavors of black plum and vanilla set against herbal undertones. Spice, chocolate, carob and drawing tannins create a bold but rough finish.","1054":"Dark in color and forcefully oaked on the nose, this resiny Malbec will appeal to fans of richly styled reds. Plum, berry, tomato leaf and herbal flavors finish woody but fair, with lasting acidity.","1185":"Apricot and oak aromas make for a smoky, slightly heavy bouquet. The wine keeps that weightiness as it passes from nectarine to citrus to tropical fruits. Long on the finish, with integrity. But it's also a bit citric in the center. \u201cPulpy\u201d is another descriptor.","1189":"Toast and char sit atop the bouquet like a heavy king on his throne, but there's nothing fake or weak about it. The color is dark and the palate is round; flavors of black plum, figs and black olives convey a meaty, true personality amid all the char, chocolate and vanilla. A good wine in the massive category that is value-priced Merlot.","1193":"Aromas of blackberry and briar patch expand to include violet notes. In the mouth, there's pulpy weight to the fruit and rubbery tannins for framing. Rugged but generic black-fruit flavors finish with toasty darkness and some burn.","1209":"Rubbery, gaseous initial aromas give way to piquant red-fruit notes. This feels lean, racy and very high in acidity. Limited flavors of currant, tomato and salty red plum finish with herbal notes and persistent saltiness as well as abrasive acidity.","1210":"Leathery aromas of horseradish and stewed berries lead to a rooty, syrupy palate. Flavors of cola, chocolate and raisin are creamy as a whole. This tastes ripe on the finish, with raisin and oxidized notes. This Merlot-Cabernet-Malbec blend has its strong points but comes across baked and raisiny.","1411":"This screaming violet-colored chunkster is big and blocky up front, with aromas of vitamins and grapy black fruits. A giant palate holds big tannins, while heady flavors of black plum and oak spice finish minty, toasty and with power.","1499":"Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors. Acidity is on the high side, so the feel and finish have some burn. Could use some pizza or meat to help it along.","1510":"Light, floral and somewhat out of the mold. Flavors of apricot, peach and mango are both fresh and fleshy, while the finish lingers for quite some time. Fairly forceful but restrained enough.","1513":"Round, nutty and smooth, with melon, citrus and apple flavors. In this wine's case, organic does not equal complexity. That said, what's here is clean and balanced, and there's more than enough fruit and intensity to satisfy.","1602":"Flat aromas of lanolin and oily white fruits lead to a round, full palate that's getting tired. Salty nectarine and flowery flavors finish with a yeasty note of ham and white fruits.","1636":"Tropical aromas of lychee and honeydew set up a straightforward palate. Powdery flavors of green melon and lychee are light and flowery on a modest finish.","1639":"Aromas of dish soap and fruit salad show on the nose while the palate brings pink grapefruit and orange. A citric finish with a peppery note lacks acidity, so drink now.","1643":"Lightly spicy raspberry aromas are raw and peppery. This feels fleshy and pulpy, with punchy acidity. Peppery berry flavors are boosted by toasty oak that carries over to a mildly hot finish.","1651":"This youthful pink-colored number smells of dusty cherry and Lifesavers. A juicy palate has a soda-like feel, while flavors of raspberry and cherry are light and dilute across the finish.","1661":"Lime and tangerine aromas are light and dusty, with a yeasty note. This feels mostly sound but basic, with leesy, melony flavors. On the finish, this loses intensity and turns bready in flavor and soft in feel.","1663":"Reedy green-leaning aromas of plum and raspberry feed into a creamy palate. This tastes primarily of herbal red-berry fruits that finish oaky, dry and spicy.","1666":"Dry earthy herbal aromas of tomato, red-berry fruits and oak set up a full palate with pounding tannins. This tastes roasted and herbal, with notes of bell pepper, tomato and creamy oak. A hard-tannin finish confirms that this Merlot skipped charm school.","1679":"Oily aromas of citrus peel and lychee set up a lemony palate with pyrazine-influenced citrus flavors. Lychee is the lead flavor on a finish that's mildly bitter.","1709":"Solid and smooth from the beginning, with cola, pastry and blackberry aromas. The palate is fresh, full and healthy, with cola, black pepper and a ton of berry push. Toasty and roasted on the finish, where coffee comes into play. Right on the spot for value-priced Malbec.","1830":"Damp, foresty, stalky aromas are backed by a chunky, slightly sticky feeling palate. Black cherry and mocha flavors set the stage for a ripe finish, with brown-sugar sweetness.","1837":"Salmon-colored and spritzy, this ros\u00e9 of Pinot Grigio smells stony and peachy. A zesty palate has sizzle and zest to it, while stone-fruit and minerally flavors are salty prior to a mildly bitter finish that tastes of pithy citrus.","1916":"Blackberry and cassis aromas share the bouquet with tougher, more masculine notes of earth, rubber and char. Once it opens on the palate, there's ripe raspberry, plum and a nod to the black side of the fruit spectrum. Finishes with a mild kick of tannins and the essence of coffee and pepper. A solid blend of Cabernet and Merlot from the improving Uco Valley.","1919":"Black plum, cola and chocolate define this textbook Malbec. The wine has body, heft and lots of fruit, but also some complexity and character. Flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis are layered and fairly boisterous, while the mouthfeel is firm and just slightly tannic. Just right for red meats and pastas.","2010":"Gritty, roasted berry aromas are rubbery and hint at Band-Aids. In the mouth, this is O.K. in feel, albeit a bit jammy and thick. Short, generic berry flavors come with minty accents and some green on the finish.","2019":"Dry, spicy aromas aren't overly ripe or expressive. In the mouth, this basic Cab is raw, racy and spiky in feel. Flavors of herbal red-berry fruits are leafy, while finishing flavors of carob and pepper register as adequate.","2029":"Dusty aromas of balloon rubber and apple juice are sketchy, but in the mouth this is fair and balanced. Flavors of lychee, mango candy and sweet papaya finish soft and lightly oxidized.","2103":"Aggressive smelling early on but then it settles on classy raspberry, cassis and herbs. The palate is very healthy, juicy, rich and big, but the flavors of dark berry fruit are subtle and smooth. Chunky, sweet and ripe on the finish. A Malbec to drink this winter. Only 300 cases produced.","2161":"Grassy stalky berry aromas lean towards green. This feels grippy, while spicy herbal berry flavors stay the course and finish with minty green notes on top of basic plum and berry.","2175":"Briny, cidery aromas are a touch stale. This has a basic citrusy mouthfeel along with flavors of orange and tangerine that turn mildly bitter and pithy on the finish.","2275":"Chunky, broad and slightly rubbery smelling, with baked aromas, leather and other more serious scents. The palate is full-bodied and warm, but not all that complex. Flavors of baked plums, cassis and licorice are nice, and the finish brings chocolate brownie into the game. For immediate drinking.","2298":"There's no denying the fact that this smells stalky and burnt, with leathery fruit aromas. In the mouth, it's choppy, with scratchy acidity leading to a loud flavor profile with stalky berry, raisin and stewed flavors. Heat and additional roasted notes drive the finish on this Malbec.","2313":"This is exceedingly ripe tasting, with a syrupy texture. Along the way, you'll encounter tar and rubber aromas in front of flavors such as carob, vanilla and stewed berry fruits. A minty, oaky finish is the final weighty act.","2373":"Pencil eraser, iodine, latex and blueberry aromas settle better than they start. In the mouth, this is saturated and chunky in feel, with toasty flavors of blackberry, licorice and mint that finish long, herbal and loamy.","2409":"Racy plum and cherry aromas lead to an edgy palate with bold acidity. Crisp, foxy flavors of raspberry and plum finish spicy and with pronounced acidity. This wine emphasizes acidity and freshness over ripeness and heft.","2575":"Strapping currant and berry aromas come with a full dosage of toasty oak. This Malbec feels sinewy, with good depth. Oaky notes of toast and blackened spice lend a chocolaty essence to berry and plum flavors, while this finishes with an herbal, spicy aftertaste.","2639":"Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness.","2693":"Blackberry and cassis aromas blend seamlessly with varietal scents of herbs and leaves. This Cab Franc feels crisp yet flush, with laudable structure and vital acidity. Flavors of leafy, spicy berry and plum finish with peppery notes, a jolt of salinity and heft.","2815":"Apple and white fruit aromas set up a balanced, reasonably full palate, with banana, creamy oak, vanilla and apple flavors. It feels solid and round, with a clean finish.","2947":"Foxy and jumpy smelling at first, with brambly raspberry aromas. The palate feels heavy and baked, with grabby tannins in support of herbal, mildly weedy berry fruit flavors. Finishes saucy, with a hint of tomato. Not pure and focused like the La Flor Malbec.","2956":"Basic apricot and peach aromas lead to melon, banana and pithy flavors. The palate is a little thick and mealy, while the finish has pretty good feel and length, but not much flavor. Slightly tropical and simple.","2957":"Sharp, minty aromas mixed with stemmy red fruit set up a modest, middleweight palate of semisweet, generic red fruit flavors. Quick on the finish, with a spot of green flavor. Good enough but lacks the concentration and deeper aromas and flavors of Urban Malbec.","2964":"Aromas of white grapefruit, celery and other prickly fruits lose steam with airing, while the green apple and lime flavors are solid and offer some sweetness. Wet in the mouth, which is what you want, but standard fare as a whole.","2970":"Lime and green melon aromas are a bit less than clean and pure, and the palate serves up a pile of jalape\u00f1o and bell pepper, with some lime in the background. Short on the finish, and kind of dilute.","2977":"Mildly smoky and toasty aromas lead to a lightly oaked palate that's largely defined by black cherry and some rich berry syrup. It's a full, colorful Syrah with a chunky mouthfeel and a satisfying but short finish. Drink now.","2987":"Better than most Argentinean Sauvignon Blancs, and made in a fuller-bodied style. The nose has weight and wax aromas, as well as melon, and the palate features ripe, almost pithy citrus. Dried apricot and a nick of passion fruit work the finish. Drink immediately.","3068":"Cherry, cassis and root beer aromas are appealing. In the mouth, this is wall-to-wall rough due to fierce tannins. Baked berry flavors are blocky and simmer away on a rugged finish.","3079":"Loamy berry aromas smell a bit like wet clay and earth. This is fairly well structured, with grippy tannins. Baked, savory, oaky berry flavors finish with wood spice, clove and light herbal notes.","3080":"Earthy black-fruit aromas set up a rubbery, heavy palate with plenty of oak and related resin. This tastes mostly of oak and clove, with savory blackberry notes resting at the base. A solid salty choppy finish shows a tight grip and moderate roughness.","3157":"Earthy, deep and true to its Uco Valley roots; this is a very good and fairly serious Malbec that doesn't try to overstep its natural limitations. It's not too extracted or oaky but instead delivers robust blackberry, plum and caramel flavors backed by a warm, mildly oaky finish with menthol and mocha. Drink now into 2010.","3170":"An intense, forward style of Malbec. The nose oozes a mixture of mint, black-fruit extract and shoe polish, while the saturated palate is racy and just rich enough; the flavors of blackberry and plum are lively with coffee and mocha accents on the finish. A bit acidic and racy, but that won't hurt it if served with food.","3178":"Fresh and reasonably fruity on the nose, but it's also slightly gritty and tough. Shows medium weight and intensity in the mouth, with a medicinal red-berry flavor accented by spice and herb notes. It finishes dry and mildly oaky.","3180":"This blend of 88% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Cabernet Franc is rustic smelling, with a rubbery, tannic mouthfeel and flavors of roasted plum and berry. Let this wine aerate to show its best.","3186":"Black in color, this wine has reduced aromas of blueberry, cumin and bitter chocolate. Thick and generous in the mouth, but also rugged, with sweet blackberry and bacon flavors and a lot of toasty-oak influence.","3303":"\u201cCocina\u201d means \u201cthe kitchen\u201d in Spanish, and this blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is definitely a kitchen-sink type of wine. It's stout, a bit reduced and tinny at first, but with air it turns into a nice, simple chunkster with plump baked-fruit flavors and a soft but structured chocolaty finish. Drink now.","3306":"Rubbery and smoky at first, with leather and berry fruit running secondary to the wine's more reduced qualities. But if given ten minutes to unwind, it shows wide black-fruit flavors, creaminess and finally some barrel-based resin. Gets better the more you work with it, but will always register as \u201coaky.\u201d","3417":"Tropical aromas revolve around lemon-lime. This is acidic without much body. Flavors of lemon, melon, mango and green apple are lean and finish with tangy, pithy citrus flavors.","3425":"Wiry, briary currant and herbal aromas announce a hard but juicy wine with buttery oak, salty red fruit flavors and a loud herbal angle. This is both briny tasting and a touch weedy on the finish.","3477":"Cola, plum and red-currant aromas set up a tight palate with clamping tannins. Flavors of black cherry, cassis, plum and chocolate are lasting across the finish. This needs hearty food, additional airing or both to show its best.","3482":"Odd aromas of curried meat and iodine are more unusual than off-putting. This feels a bit wide and heavy, with flatness to the palate. Flavors of roasted plum and savory spices suggest lamb curry, while this feels robust and aggressive on a slightly hot finish.","3596":"Aromas of apple cider, peach and oak lead to a full palate. Flavors of melon and banana have a nutty quality, while this is stable on the finish, with tropical fruit and honeyed flavors. Drink now.","3598":"This Bonarda could be your everyday red or house pour with no issues. Solid berry aromas are fairly woody and a bit earthy. A bouncy, fresh palate is cheerful, while flavors of plum, blackberry, cassis and spices are toasty and forward-moving on the finish.","3604":"Saucy, earthy berry aromas are full of oak and clove notes. This wine feels full but not too heavy, with solid overall balance. Blackberry, dark plum, toast and spicy oak flavors finish peppery and stout, with ripe, chewy tannins. Drink through 2022.","3682":"Apartado, a high-flying Bordeaux blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, shows up only occasionally, but when it does it shines. This vintage is stunning; the black cherry and wild berry flavors are lively and honest, while the wine's structure is just where it should be. With a juicy steak or lamb chops, this wine will bowl you over.","3726":"This Malbec-led blend is quite oaky, thus maple, molasses and chocolate aromas ride high alongside blackberry and mild floral notes. In the mouth, this is quasi-syrupy and very rich. Flavors of baked black fruits and brown sugar finish sticky, with chunky weight. Drink through 2018.","3736":"A mixture of coconut, cedar and marzipan scents along with gritty, briary black-fruit aromas precedes a lively palate with weight, power and balance. Flavors of berry, plum and cassis are bold, oaky and chocolaty, while the finish hits hard with mocha, caramel and vanilla notes offset by bright acidity. Drink through 2018.","3785":"Savory scents, a whiff of animal and jammy berry aromas set up a large palate with choppy tannins and lots of breadth. This Malbec-lead blend shows roasted, rubbery black-fruit flavors and a fairly smooth but oaky finish.","3786":"Dense aromas of prune and raisin scream \u201coverripe.\u201d In the mouth, this is heavy, saturated and stewy in feel. Flavors of cr\u00e8me de cassis and brandied cherry finish baked and raisiny. Drink now.","3943":"This waxy, heavily oaked Chardonnay regularly pulls the same score. This vintage has aromas of grapefruit, quince and garlic. Blasting oak and modest acidity result in flatness, while oak resin is by far the dominant flavor, with creamy apple and pithy bitterness lurking.","3956":"Sharp, prickly aromas suggest tart red plum and wild herbs. The palate is a bit heavy and sticky, with sweet, gummy, medicinal berry flavors. Finishes bitter and peppery, with a medicinal aftertaste.","3961":"Red plum, tomato and brambly herbal aromas set up a snappy, astringent palate with strained raspberry, spice and herbal flavors. Very dry and acidic as it transitions to the finish. An herbal, sharp-edged red.","3967":"Sweet and syrupy smelling, with maple-covered doughnut and muddled spice and tree bark aromas. The palate is more cutting and acidic than expected, with a sheer mouthfeel and heavy vanilla and oak flavors covering up underdeveloped red fruit notes. Hard, crisp and tannic stuff.","3968":"Heavy and stalky smelling, with burnt aromas. The leaden palate is weighty and short on freshness; tastes pithy and stalky, with some nectarine and plum thrown in. Seems to be fading.","3978":"Smells earthy and leathery, with a grilled meat element to the nose. The palate runs sharp and high in acid, with narrow plum flavors. Doesn't offer a whole lot on the finish. More rubbery and tart than ideal.","3988":"Round, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic. The nose brings richness, smoke and black fruits, while the palate is juicy, focused and forward, with black-fruit flavor galore and a slight creamy character. Drying and toasty on the finish, with snappy acidity through the final drop.","4020":"Sweet and frothy, and made quite close to the Moscato style, meaning the nose is full of flowers and lime. The palate is a mix of crushed children's vitamins, mango and ripe melon.","4026":"Aromas of brick dust, tobacco, red flowers and cassis come with a touch of herbal green scents. This feels healthy and balanced, with flavors of herbal berry and currant. Things turn a bit saucy and more herbal on the finish.","4069":"Roasted, gritty aromas of bacon and spicy oak are burnt on the surface. This is fleshy and full in body, with moderate acidity. Herbal, minty, lightly green berry flavors have a rooty accent and oaky makeup. Finishing flavors of mint and raw oak blend into herbal berry leftovers.","4074":"Aromas of oak, mint and cola accent earthy black-fruit scents in front of a palate that's tannic and raw but firm and structured. Berry and salty, oaky flavors finish with grabby, drying tannins and peppery spice.","4078":"Earthy aromas of raisin, blackberry, barnyard and animal are dense. This feels clampy, grabby and heavy, with just enough acidity to maintain a sense of balance. Salty, savory plum and berry flavors finish with a final wave of salt and earthy, roasted berry fruit.","4245":"Mild white-fruit aromas come with overt oak scents. A theme of heavy oak is continued on this barrel-driven blend of Tocai, Viognier, Pinot Gris and Chardonnay. Woody flavors outweigh milder spiced apple notes, while this remains oak-dominated on the finish.","4249":"Rugged rustic gritty aromas of roasted plum, saddle leather and baked beans may cause some head scratching. Speaking of scratch, this is scratchy on the palate and a bit weak in the middle. Flavors of stewed berry fruits and rubber finish with grating tannins.","4258":"Exotic citrus and orange blossom aromas are lively and a touch oily. This is racy and fresh, with substance to the mouthfeel. Peachy stone-fruit flavors hint at orange and lychee, while this is lasting and intense on the finish. Drink now.","4395":"A smooth operator with sweet aromas of cotton candy, caramel and baked black plum. The palate is exceedingly flush yet refined, while the meaty flavor profile entails roasted berry fruit and herbs. Finishes with sweet, easy notes of caramel and toast. Drink now through 2013.","4397":"Clean, cedary and dynamic, with fine black-fruit aromas on the nose. The palate has a full, layered texture that impresses, while the flavors of black cherry, blackberry and boysenberry carry toasty, dark, chocolaty accents. Savory and warm on the finish, with lots of power. A blend of 75% Malbec with 20% Tempranillo and 5% Syrah.","4595":"Damp earthy berry aromas are a touch murky. This feels bulky, grabby and tannic, while overriding flavors of coffee, toast and bitter chocolate make fruit a bit player. A choppy finish with hard tannins and herbal berry flavors puts this Cabernet in the midtier category.","4649":"Saturated in color as well as on the nose, this fruit-packed Malbec opens with grapy black-plum and cassis aromas. An intensely bold palate is loaded to the hilt with black cherry, blackberry and integrated oak and spice flavors. A lush, steady finish unfolds in due time and with no disparate parts; drink from 2019\u20132025.","4658":"This single-vineyard Malbec blend from vineyards that sit at 6,500 feet smells dark, grilled and rubbery, but also meaty and full of fruit. A full, lush palate avoids fierceness and lays on the richness. Toasty, lightly herbal berry and plum flavors are highly appealing. The wine tastes of herbs, salted meat and spices on a complex finish. Drink through 2024.","4663":"Generous oak is reflected via aromas of hickory and smoke on the nose of this lusty but refined blend of Cabernet and Malbec. In the mouth, rugged tannins and high acidity suggest further cellaring. Flavors of plum, berry, chocolate and tomato sauce finish with dry, pulling tannins and a sense of acidic freshness. Drink through 2027.","4683":"Bold and earthy wine, with aromas of fine rubber, balsam wood, forest floor, spice and ripe black fruit. It's thick as it rolls over the palate, and the wild berry, herb and pepper flavors fit the wine's physique and profile. Long and fairly deep on the finish; drink now through 2011.","4800":"Chunky, slightly rubbery aromas revolve around black fruits and oak. This is a dense, thick wine with blackberry, plum, fig and bitter chocolate flavors. The finish is dark and weighty in this meaty Malbec.","4803":"This wonderful under-$20 Malbec opens with a blast of black-fruit aromas as well as mild rubber scents and minerality. The palate is solid, with baked berry and integrated saline and mineral flavors. A bright, lively finish with a ton of berry essence closes this out.","4812":"Licorice, cardamom, blueberry and cassis aromas are subtle but complementary. A firm, healthy feel isn't particularly hard or tannic, while candied berry and sweet oak flavors lead to a long, smooth finish. This blend of 67% Malbec and 33% Cab Sauvignon is ripe, ready and exemplifies Mendoza's penchant for big wines with balance. Only 150 cases made.","4824":"Generic on the nose, with undistinguished aromas of red fruits and candy. Feels plump and tastes a bit stalky, with generic red cherry, plum skin and candied flavors. Harmless and a touch sweet; drink well chilled.","4841":"Opens with aromas of tomato leaf, fresh salsa and rubber. Later on red fruit enters the picture, and on the palate there's adequate raspberry and plum with a hint of chocolate. Feelwise, it's a touch gummy. But overall this wine from Patagonia is solid and proves that Argentinean Pinot Noir has its merits.","4937":"A mix of cedary oak, rich berry fruit and spice aromas come together seamlessly on the nose of this ripe, chunky Cab Franc, something Andeluna has been working on for years and now has right. Rooty black-fruit flavors come with plenty of oak spice, chocolate and pepper notes, while the finish is long, spicy and comfortable. Drink through 2020.","4941":"Earthy, stewy aromas of baked berry and tree bark are typical for this winery. This blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet is dense, layered and shows just enough acidity to stay upright. Baked, stewy flavors of blackberry, beef jerky, pepper and carob finish loamy in feel, with a touch of chocolate and herbal flavor. Drink through 2020.","4962":"A bit grassy and green, with good power, herbal black fruit aromas, spice and cola. The palate is very high in acidity, which at first creates a sheering sharpness and tart plum flavors. With more airing it grows rounder and more complex, but overall it's exacting, odd and funky.","4997":"As a whole, this is top-shelf Malbec with weight, character and complexities. It's also a touch gamy on the nose, with a no-miss blast of compost. Beyond that, the palate shows lemony oak and tight tannins on top of oaky, leathery flavors of robust berry and baked plum. Drink this rock-solid specimen now through 2016.","5098":"Spunky, youthful aromas of wild berry and currant are aggressive but fresh in style. This is a juicy, forward, bright Malbec with boysenberry flavors followed by a short wave of bitter chocolate and toast. It finishes in the same style.","5104":"Lychee and melon aromas are proper for Torront\u00e9s. And while this has Viognier and Chardonnay in the blend, it's Torront\u00e9s that dominates via a spritzy, citrusy mouthfeel and flavors of lychee, nectarine and citrus fruits. A fresh, lively but simple finish confirms the wine's refreshment potential.","5223":"This is a woody, oak-dominated Malbec, but it's also ripe and well made. Aromas of sawdust, vanilla and toast support raw berry essence. In the mouth, tartaric notes stick out amid the richness, while flavors of oak, toast, vanilla and berry fruits finish woody but with wayward acidity.","5342":"Oak is front and center on the bouquet, and with that come accents of dried cheese and sawdust. Feels saturated, layered and tannic in the mouth, with roasted berry, black plum, herb and spice flavors. Feels and tastes a touch resiny on the finish, more evidence of the wine's barrel influence.","5348":"A big, dark, extracted Malbec with murky lead aromas of Graham cracker and sweet blueberry. The palate is jammy and chunky, with dark, earthy flavors of prune, blackberry and raisin. Finishes a bit pruny, but there's enough acidity to maintain a sense of balance. Drink now.","5349":"Bright, vivid and sizzling on the nose, then zesty, tight and acidic in the mouth, with high-toned plum, berry and red currant flavors offset by a touch of milk chocolate. Long on the finish, but not that nuanced or complex.","5440":"Spicy, medicinal cherry, tomato and herb aromas lead to a palate with rubbery tannins and moderate astringency. A fresh and tasty mix of spicy, rooty berry flavors ends with brushy, herbal, chocolaty notes on the finish.","5443":"Stout up front, the nose is packed with black-fruit aromas. The palate feels a bit prickly and raw, while blackberry flavors run quick, with a chocolaty oak character popping up on a lean finish.","5456":"Saucy, woody aromas of plum and berry are good but strained. This smacks down with high acidity and a sense of tomato. Salty flavors of tomato, herbs, red plum and currant remain salty on the finish.","5460":"Smoky and rustic upfront, this mature Nebbiolo smells of cherry, cassis and wet cement. In the mouth, this is a bit heavy and syrupy, with grabby tannins and an overall sticky feel. Ripe, candied berry, cocoa and oaky flavors flatten out and turn chocolaty on the finish.","5465":"Reedy aromas of olive, leather and oak are less than fruity and lush. This has a hard, edgy, abrasive mouthfeel along with pinched, salty flavors of plum and berry fruits. Earthy berry flavors and drying tannins are in charge on the finish.","5468":"Smoke, rubber and spice aromas mix with ripe berry scents to form a solid and impressive bouquet. It's thick and saturated but balanced, with harmonious, easy to like flavors of blackberry and cassis. Long and solid on the finish; captures the essence of value-priced Malbec.","5471":"Concentrated and jammy smelling, with a note of iodine to go with racy black fruit aromas. Dense as night in the mouth, with gamey, roasted berry flavors. Turns minty on the finish, with a hint of herbal green. Fruity and nice but lacks that final gear.","5545":"Rich, loamy and ripe smelling, this wine opens in fine form, with accents of raisin, cassis and ink. The mouthfeel is deep and balanced, while flavors of toasty blackberry, cassis and chocolate are ripe and modern. Finishing notes of coffee, licorice, blackened toast and pepper bring a dark side to this long-lasting, deeply etched Malbec. Drink through 2018.","5588":"Pure and striking from the start, with menthol aromas that come with blackberry and cassis. Feels dense and concentrated, with blackberry, prune and dark spice flavors. Layered, mellow and slight jammy on the multitiered finish. Drink now.","5597":"Blackberry and rubber aromas are friendly and forward, with spice added in for good measure. Feels full, lush and cushioned, with integrated tannins, good acidity and bright red berry flavors dusted by herbs and spice. Finishes smooth and true. A winning wine from a difficult vintage.","5603":"An interesting, well-made blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat that deals lemony oak, spice, coconut and ripe berry aromas. Stocky and firm, with nice balance and bold tannins framing flavors of lemon peel, clove, herbs, toast and berry fruit. A complete package; drink now through 2014.","5610":"Dynamic aromas of honeysuckle and mint gumdrop precede intense honey, orange, tangerine and marmalade flavors. This is a thicker, more oily style of Torrontes than the commonly seen watery ones, and it makes a statement via its viscosity and power.","5618":"Butter and dill are the first aromas to make themselves noticed, and below that there's raw oak and lighter-weight fruit notes. The palate shows ample resin and wood notes along with pepper and spice. It's a good wine with serious intent, but it seems a little overwooded and a tiny bit green. Cabernet Sauvignon leads the blend, with Merlot and Cab Franc filling it out.","5826":"Leafy, spicy, dry berry aromas lead to a jacked up, edgy palate with hard, scraping tannins. Forced woodspice and raw plum flavors finish more spicy than fruity.","5827":"Damp and furry on the nose, this is all tannins and scratch. High acidity only contributes to the grating mouthfeel, hence it's a bumpy ride where standard berry flavors are a sideshow. Chento 2012 is a better bet if it's still on the shelf.","5859":"Aromas are leafy and scratchy, also suggesting cement. This feels resiny and creamy in the mouth. Flavors of woody, generic berry fruits finish hot and scratchy.","5860":"Melon and tropical-fruit aromas precede a juice-like palate that struggles with mouthfeel. Flavors of mealy apple and peach finish with melon and green banana notes. Overall this is just good enough to enjoy as a quaffer.","5868":"This smells flowery but also flabby and oily. The palate has a creamy, tropical feel to it and flavors of melon, papaya and powdered sugar. A soft, lightly bitter-tasting finish could use more pop, scour and balance.","5935":"Shows little on the nose, while the palate is bland and flat, with simple apple and lemon flavors. Soft and chunky white wine with some drab tropicality.","5940":"Stalky and green smelling, with tobacco and stemmy fruit aromas. The palate is scratchy and stewy, with soupy flavors of tomato and raspberry. Herbal on the deficient finish.","5941":"Wild, edgy and hot on the nose, which breaks up fast. The palate is narrow, sweet and pruney; stewed up on the finish and grapey throughout.","5946":"A rough, pinchy nose with leather and funk is no way to begin. The palate stays hard and spiky, with burnt, rustic, murky flavors. Roasted and mossy on the finish, and not very good overall.","5949":"Medicinal and feral on the nose, then heavy, thick and extremely creamy and soft in the mouth, with bland, flat flavors of milk, carob and vanilla. Short on fruit, acidity and purpose.","6138":"Vanilla, popcorn, resiny oak, pear and pineapple aromas come in front of a creamy feeling palate. Flavors of oak, vanilla, popcorn and tropical fruits end similarly. This is consistently sweet and oaky from nose to palate to finish.","6139":"Strawberry, field grass and creamy, lactic aromas feed into a bright palate with ripe but short flavors of melon and spiced apple. This is dry and dusty on the finish, with fresh acidity and a touch of powdered sugar flavor.","6243":"This blend of Malbec and Syrah is dark as night, with rubbery, heavy aromas of reduced blackberry and plum along with a hint of volatility. Chunky, heavy and tannic on the palate, this offers blackberry, oak and acidic coffee flavors in front of an herbal, leathery finish.","6249":"Initial grassy aromas of hay and wheat usher in scents of peach, melon and saline water. This is a bit pulpy on the palate, but with cutting acidity. Melon, apple cider and nectarine flavors finish with friendly but nondescript white-fruit flavors.","6339":"Maderized in color, this Viognier shows powdery aromas of lychee and tropical fruits. The body is round, plump and soft, while flavors of pear, almond paste, lychee and chemical turn more flat and bitter the longer this sits.","6354":"Citrus, tropical notes and a bit of skunky funk define the nose on this unoaked Chard. The palate is slightly metallic in feel, while the flavors suggest canned peaches and nectarine.","6412":"This is Renacer's first Cabernet Franc, and it's excellent. Light herb notes, fine wood and deep black-fruit aromas make for a superb entry. The palate is loaded with power, but a touch of bold tartaric acidity does stick out. Black cherry, kirsch, mocha and chocolate flavors finish amid a lush mix of chocolaty oak, related spices and deliciousness. Drink through 2021.","6424":"Inky in color, with exotic, gaseous and balsamic aromas of black fruits and iodine, this biodynamic Malbec-Syrah blend is funky, jumpy, tartatic and jumbled on the palate. Stew, somewhat sour and earthy berry flavors finish scratchy but with length and energy.","6439":"Earthy rubbery berry aromas suggest pencil eraser and rubber. This Malbec-Syrah blend feels chunky and on the heavy side. Baked blackberry and chocolate flavors finish stewy and wayward.","6441":"Gritty aromas of herbal berry fruits and coffee grounds lead to a hard tannic, compact palate with loud acidity. Disparate flavors of burnt coffee, tomato and stewed plum finish with scraping tannins and herbal notes that reflect the nose and palate.","6443":"This copper-tinted ros\u00e9 of Pinot Noir smells like a rubber gym ball and citrus fruits. A full round bouncy palate brings it around, while dry citrus and stone-fruit flavors show a skins-like quality on a steady finish.","6528":"Aromas of oak and orange peel include a strong whiff of clove. This is creamy and resiny in feel, while oaky flavors\u2014clove in particular\u2014sit on top of red-fruit notes. Dry barrel-related flavors are hot on the finish.","6539":"Berry and lemon-peel aromas come with a note of plastic. This feels narrow and acidic, and thus scraping. Tart plum and spice flavors lead to an herbal high-acid palate that leaves a sour lasting impression.","6546":"Earthy plum and raspberry aromas are probing and raw. This feels acidic to the point of cutting. Sour, salty, herbal red-fruit flavors are gritty and rough on the finish. This is Salta Cabernet in its most raw, least appealing form.","6550":"Earthy aromas of animal and stewed black fruits set up a hot palate with oaky mint and clove flavors. This is gripping and warm on the finish, with an excess of oak and hard tannins.","6554":"The intent here seems to be a low-alcohol \u201cpure\u201d expression of Bonarda. But with volatile high-toned cherry and raspberry aromas along with a narrow scouring palate, this comes across as tart and lean. Sour herbal red-plum flavors are raw on the finish.","6679":"This extremely dark-colored Malbec offers mellow blueberry and blackberry aromas. The palate is big, jammy feeling and features only pokes of acidic cut. Inky black-fruit flavors come with licorice, peppercorn notes and heat. The finish is solid but limited in scope. Drink now through 2016.","6706":"The wine has a dark, crusty top to the nose, with solid berry aromas under that. The palate is bright, zesty and features familiar plum and black cherry flavors. And the finish is straightforward but smooth. Stylish, with a little snap, crackle and pop.","6707":"A big, full-bodied Malbec with charm. The nose is toasty, with black fruit, chocolate and other stocky, earthy aromas. Saturated in the mouth, with concentrated black fruit flavors. Shows touches of mint and spice on the finish along with coffee, licorice and chocolate. Drink now through 2012.","6799":"Spicy, briary berry and leather aromas are full and firm. On the palate, this feels fresh, with good body and depth. Flavors of black plum, blackberry and black currant are spicy but not pushy, while the finish is not overly oaky or heavy.","6813":"Lactic aromas of creamy oak, latex and plastic come with a hint of mocha. Resilient on the palate, it has oaky, lactic flavors of black plum and cassis. A candied tasting, creamy finish is fresh and firm. The blend is 78% Malbec and 22% Cabernet Sauvignon.","6814":"This aged Cabernet is mild, mellow and earthy on the nose, with aromas of tobacco and baked berry fruits. Acidity is pronounced on the palate; after that there's a mix of spice, cherry and cassis flavors. Loud acidity on the finish freshens things up while creating citric scour. Drink now.","6856":"Full berry aromas are fresh but come with a lot of oak and spice. In the mouth, this Syrah (with 3% Viognier) is chewy and a bit syrupy, with minty, spicy flavors derived from loud oak. On the finish, it dries out and turns warm-to-hot as it fades away. A joint-venture wine between Trapiche and Joey Tensley of California.","6874":"This is a high-quality Malbec with fleshy berry aromas that veer towards raisiny reduction but don't quite get there. It's plump and buttery on the palate, with baked berry, plum and herb flavors that lead to a smooth finish with a licorice accent. Drink now through 2017.","6894":"Once again, this Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend from Norton excels. The nose is a bit grapy and candied, but there's depth and a level of intensity that bodes well for the future. The palate is deep and concentrated, with blackberry, prune, stewed plum, graphite and coffee flavors in front of a mellow, smooth finish.  Drink now through 2016.","6904":"Spicy, slightly green aromas of plum and currant open this Cabernet Franc. The tight, solid palate is light in feel and not overextracted. Saucy, oaky flavors of berry fruits, spice and cocoa finish with a distinct flavor of oak. Drink through 2019.","6913":"Citrus blossom and leesy vanilla notes open this balanced aromatic white from Argentina's north. Leesy tropcial-fruit flavors focus on lychee and lime. The wine is moderately long on a simple but solid finish.","6916":"Coffee, beef stock, blackberry and graphite aromas require patience to process. A lively, ringing palate is jammy at its essence. Dark, toasty flavors of blackberry and blueberry are mildly green and herbal. It feels rubbery on a tannic finish.","6946":"A strong oak character drives the nose, which also shows aromas of mint, tobacco and prune. This is extracted to the point of being chunky, while flavors of spiced plum and berry fruits have an herbal undertone. Staunch tannins and soupy, minty flavors are prominent on the finish.","6951":"Boisterous black plum and blackberry aromas properly announce an extra grabby palate with rock-hard tannins. This tastes like roasted plum, cassis and blackened spices. Tannic and dry as a bone on the finish, with a savory note.","6956":"Oily citrus aromas are pungent on the nose. This is chunky but braced by firm acidity. Waxy, warm, oaky flavors of caramel and baked apple finish with punchy citric acidity and an oak-based touch of butterscotch.","7101":"Grassy, herbal aromas rest on top of basic red-fruit notes. This feels choppy and hollow, with flavors of buttery oak, chemical and red currant. The raw hot finish doesn't have a lot of body or padding.","7123":"From La Rioja, this Torront\u00e9s is quiet and neutral. It offers a little tangerine on the nose, and then acceptable but unexciting banana and pear flavors. Overall it's decent but bland.","7138":"Aggressive and ultra-bubbly, with gassy apple, pear and pineapple aromas. The palate runs sharp, with green apple controlling the flavor profile. Sudsy and monotone on the finish, with a bland, green-ish aftertaste.","7142":"The only thing that makes this a gran reserva is the label and the winery's commitment to a big, extracted, heavily oaked wine. It's black as ink but clumsy as can be. Smells and tastes like shoe polish, resin and oily fruit. Not what we're looking for from Argentina, or anywhere for that matter. Barely acceptable. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.","7175":"Peach, pear, melon and vanilla aromas come with an aromatic sensation of wet rocks. Light and lifted on the palate, with honeydew, pear, lemon and stony flavors, this finishes fresh, clean and lightly powdery, with echoes of apple and pear.","7213":"Tightly wound aromas of rubber and black fruits preview a rubbery, fruity palate that's generous in its delivery of vanilla, creamy berry, black plum and cassis flavors. A comfortable finish with mocha and smooth tannins confirms that this is a cleanly made, modern red wine.","7252":"Stewy, savory aromas of prune, coffee grinds and turned earth lack freshness and liveliness. A full, dense, rubbery palate deals earthy, roasted berry, plum and currant flavors. This is big and grabby on a savory tasting finish.","7407":"Dusty dark-fruit aromas are lusty and full of oaky notes including sawdust and chocolate. This value-priced winner is full, round, saturated and generous on the palate, where savory, resiny black-fruit flavors finish woody in flavor and firm in feel.","7551":"Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness.","7560":"Cool, earthy, rooty aromas of licorice, Graham cracker, cassis and blackberry are dark and brooding. This Malbec is loosely structured, with heavy extraction and blackened, gritty flavors of blackberry and toast. A dark, rubbery, blocky finish is giant like the rest of the wine. Drink through 2022.","7563":"Lemony oak sits atop a heady bouquet supported by woody, baked-berry aromas. This is fresh and fast-moving across the palate, with rooty, toasty flavors of baked black fruits. A peppery, toasty, chocolaty finish is solid, dense and layered. Drink through 2021.","7627":"Mildly baked plum and berry aromas are big and solid, while the big-boned palate revolves around plum and rhubarb flavors. Straightforward and a touch herbal, with sticky, chewy fruit to ponder on the finish.","7688":"Raw, scratchy cherry and plum aromas are dusty and lightly herbaceous. A full, blocky, chewy palate deals roasted plum and currant flavors. On the finish, this wine tastes smoky, with a note of grilled meat.","7901":"Right away this pitch-dark Malbec displays max ripeness through a dynamic mix of prune, blackberry, coconut, violet petal and leathery aromas. A hugely concentrated palate is hardly a shock, while firm acidity cuts a viscous palate with ripe cassis, plum, blackberry and black cherry flavors. Drink this voluptuous wine through 2022.","7903":"Pure blackberry, cassis and charcoal aromas come with a sweet oak-based scent of maple. This is a beast of a wine with lushness and padding to the palate along with huge tannins and fine oak framework. Toasty, chocolaty oak flavors caress a black-fruit explosion prior to a saturated finish that spreads out like a slow-moving lava flow. Drink through 2022.","7918":"Toasty woodsmoke aromas are matched by wild berry, cassis, cherry and marshmallow scents on the nose of this huge Malbec. Creamy feeling but also inky and fully concentrated, this tastes like black cherry and cough drops. Candied ripeness carries onto the finish along with chocolate and dry spice flavors. Drink through 2022.","7919":"Blackened and charred on the nose, there are also blueberry, herb and earth notes to get this balanced yet huge Malbec going. Blackberry, black plum and pie crust flavors finish cedary, with pastry notes and lasting black fruit. If you want power but also elegance and purity from your red wine, this is it. Drink through 2022.","7978":"Cassis and blackberry aromas are bold and show a feral side as this breathes. Fresh and charged up on the palate, this hits with cassis and blackberry flavors in front of a fruity, not oaky finish. Drink this pleasurable, well-made Malbec now through 2017.","7979":"Earthy, mulchy, balsamic aromas blend with meaty blackberry scents to create a vintage D\u00e1valos-Salta bouquet. The palate on this Malbec-Cabernet blend is inky, jammy and rich, with soft tannins. Earthy, roasted flavors of blackberry and balsamic vinegar finish with notes of mushroom and tree bark along with carob and fig. Drink through 2019.","8050":"Fresh, layered aromas of black fruits and licorice are appealing. The palate is full and offers kick, while flavors of berry and plum are fairly rich, spicy and honest for $9 Cabernet. A bit sticky and it falls off on the finish, but overall it's a nice value red.","8160":"Rich aromas of raisin, cassis and blackberry are supported by notes of vanilla, smoke and sweet almond paste. While this is dense and ripe, it's also a touch edgy and raw on the palate. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, dark spices and chocolate finish with a primary wave of residual fruit then a final dose of peppery spice. Drink through 2025.","8191":"Berry aromas with subtle spice accents are damp and soothing. In the mouth, this is the opposite: All dry tannins and rawness. Hard-driving black-fruit flavors pull up short on a peppery finish. It's an honest but rough wine.","8197":"Oily aromas of peanut and burnt match ride high on the nose of this plump and pulpy tropical-leaning white. Typical lychee and honeydew flavors are slightly bitter in front of a fleshy palate with moderate acidity.","8497":"Smooth and polished, this bears cola, earth, blackberry and floral aromas. It shows power and precision, with silky tannins, integrated acidity and deep flavors of berry, leather and herb. This is slightly minty, smoky and spicy on the back end, where fine oak takes charge. Drink now\u20132015.","8500":"This opens with persuasive aromas of wild berry and cassis before cola and leather notes enter. It's a powerfully built Malbec with bright acidity, strong bones and pure, bold flavors of blackberry and black cherry. This is youthful and more fruit focused than the oakier DJN 2006 Reserva Malbec.","8925":"If you love massive Argentine reds with purity of fruit and fine oak, then this blend is up your alley. Toasty blackberry aromas come with plenty of oak grain, vanilla and depth. This is profoundly deep on the palate, while toasty blackberry, chocolate and peppery flavors finish with mocha and bracing tannins that aren't too rocky or hard. Drink through 2025.","9062":"Earthy and meaty, with aromas of dark cherry, plum and a whiff of volatility. Once things settle, it evolves into a full and flowing, semigeneric red with earnest grape and blackberry flavors along with cola. While it's hard to peg this as varietal Syrah, it's well made, balanced and full. Good for folks who like full-bodied wines.","9153":"Good but a step down from recent vintages. Big and brawny on the nose, with oak-based aromas of shoe polish, chocolate mint chips and mocha. The thick palate is deep, raisiny and chunky, with roasted black fruit flavors touched up by chocolate. Very good and likable, but not as thorough and alluring as it has been. 40% Malbec with 30% each Cabernet and Merlot.","9157":"A little sweet and candied on the nose but there are also floral aromas that are alluring. The palate is plump but offers good balance and structure, while the flavors run toward beefy dark berry fruit, spice and chocolate. Long, deep and roasted on the finish. Quite good for ten bucks.","9441":"Blackberry, cassis, mocha and chocolate aromas are typical of fine, modern Malbec, even if this contains 18% Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. A flush, widespread mouthfeel expands across all corners of the palate, while savory, toasty flavors of blackberry and licorice finish with a reprise of char as well as hickory and coffee notes. Drink this beefy wine through 2022.","9450":"This ultraripe Malbec-led blend suggests aged P. X. Sherry via raisin and citrus peel aromas. A jammy palate manages to exhibit balance, despite heavy ripeness, while flavors of blackberry, cassis and prune are dark and dense. A savory, warm, saturated finish continues the theme of maximum ripeness. Drink through 2020.","9452":"Piercing blueberry and wild berry aromas are prototypical of this label. A juicy, high-acid palate is linear and a bit edgy, but its composition bodes well for the future. Spiced plum and currant flavors finish with toast, spice and berry notes. Drink through 2024.","9470":"This overly ripe Malbec is packed with rooty spice, oak and tree bark aromas. The wine feels sticky and soupy, with a resiny texture and salty, oaky flavors of syrupy berries and mint. A sugary, cloying finish is short on freshness.","9480":"The nose is yeasty with aromas of apple and hay stalks. This feels lively and citrusy, although the structure and bubble bead are weak. Flavors of briny apple and nectarine finish with a pickled flavor and juicy acidity.","9481":"Dusty, earthy and herbal defines the nose on this minty Cab. There are also whiffs of animal and pickle on the bouquet. This feels raw and tight, with crisp acids and peppery, lightly herbal flavors of plum and berry. A minty, dry finish is slightly harsh.","9663":"This inky, concentrated, ultraripe Malbec is one of the best wines Zuccardi has produced. Aromas of blueberry, cassis, graphite and chocolate feed into a generous palate with creamy oak, mocha, baked berry and cassis flavors. The finish is lusty and big, but not biting, so you can drink this beauty anytime from now through 2017.","9747":"Initially it gives off murky, soupy aromas. But with airing it rounds into form, displaying prune and oak scents in front of a round, soft, stewy palate of chunky berry flavors. Gets better with time before finishing with toast, herbal notes and tobacco. Offers more highs than lows.","9748":"This vintage of Broquel reflects the cool, challenged characteristics of the '08 vintage. It has snap and berry aromas and flavors along with obvious oak, char and mocha. The palate is more driving and linear than previous years, with juicy, snappy cherry and wood at the base. Finishes with coffee, toast and controlled bitterness.","9749":"Not all that expressive on the nose; about all you get is basic yellow fruit and lettuce. The palate shows more intensity, but the flavors of lemon and tropical fruits are basic at best. Chunky, sweet and common on the finish. Good for Argentina but still it leaves you asking for more.","9750":"Tropical and toasty, with buttercup and banana on the nose. Good acidity keeps the palate zesty and moving forward, while the flavors of lemon, lime and pineapple are juicy and clean. Good in a fresh and simple way, with just a spot of oak character.","9751":"Savory, baked cassis and blackberry aromas show form and solidity, while the palate is deep and a little soft, with lush, slightly roasted berry and black currant aromas. Chocolaty on the finish yet not too heavy or forced. Not all that Syrah-like but it still smells and tastes good.","9765":"This concentrated, almost syrupy Malbec smells mossy and mulchy while also displaying scents of coffee grinds, tree bark and blackberry jam. A bolt of tartaric acidity keeps it from being flabby, while flavors of blackberry and black currant are salty, woody and finish resiny. Drink through 2020.","9787":"Bold aromas of tire rubber, black cherry, blackberry and stewed plum are integrated and attractive. A full, lively, rich palate offers briny black-plum and blackberry flavors in front of a creamy, salty, exuberant finish. Drink through 2018.","9799":"Oaky aromas of pencil eraser and milk chocolate are draped over cherry and red-plum notes. This feels chunky and a bit heavy and creamy, with chocolaty oak dominating the flavor profile along with medicinal berry notes. An herbal tasting choppy finish is saturated.","9805":"Initial aromas of jammy black fruits and cardamom yield to cheesy oak as this airs out. A plump wide palate is blocky, while gamy notes of animal hide, cassis, plum and oak form the flavor profile. A lingering exotic taste of blueberry centers a mild finish.","9826":"Adrianna sits at 5,000 feet, making it one of the highest vineyards in all of Mendoza. The wine shows pure Tupungato mountain fruit, with deep chocolaty undertones and lots of fine, toasty French oak. For deep berry flavors and smoothness more than rough and tough, Adrianna is on the money. Drink now through 2011.","9827":"A studly Malbec sourced from the Altamira section of the Uco Valley, then aged 18 months in new French oak. Much of this wine is fermented in plastic bins (not tanks), and the affiliated intensity grabs your attention. The blackberry flavors are potent and backed by heavy chocolate and toast. Lots of mouthfeel and power, with tannic grab. This wine can age several more years.","9839":"Big-format Malbec is what we're calling this new 15.5% wine from Benjamin de Rothschild and Laurent Dassault, original partners in Michel Rolland's Clos de los Siete project. Round, lush and full of body, Flechas shows muscle but little fat. It's colorful, dark, full of black fruit and long on the finish. It is modern Malbec done for modern palates.","9840":"Since we last tried this wine, Catena has dialed back the new oak and pumped up the natural acidity. And the result is pleasantly akin to fine Burgundy. Now the emphasis is on refined, Dijon-style apple and peach flavors with great mouthfeel. Drink now.","9851":"One of the most untouched, terroir-driven Malbecs made in Argentina is Achaval-Ferrer's Altamira. It's harvested about three weeks earlier than most high-end fruit, resulting in core raspberry flavors and a certain redness of character. The wine is unfined and cloudy but still very clear on the palate, with length, power and class. Best from 2009\u20132012.","9898":"Broquel always offers a little more elegance and pedigree than most value Malbecs, and the 2005 has body, a silky feel and aromas and flavors of tobacco, baked blackberries and leather. It's a ripe, moderately tannic wine that's best for near-term drinking.","9931":"Dark peppery earthy blackberry aromas announce a firm dry palate. For everyday Malbec, this delivers commendable black-plum, blackberry and dark-spice flavors. Pulling tannins make for a hard finish.","9956":"A standard but appealing combination of oak, spice and berry aromas leads to a clampy tannic woody palate. This is spicy and tastes fully oaked, with plum and generic berry flavors in support. On the finish, this tastes of plum, berry and chocolate.","10025":"Slightly reduced aromas of red and black fruits are rustic and come with a whiff of animal hide. This Malbec-led blend is a touch shallow in feel, with candied berry flavors that suggest wild herbs and garrigue. A light, jumpy, fruity finish eschews weight for freshness.","10107":"Bold berry fruit, mint, shoe polish and creamy oak aromas are present on the nose of this full, plump, fairly tannic Malbec. Flavors of ripe blackberry, spice and raw oak finish toasty and pure, with good length and clarity.","10140":"Tea, spice, tomato and dried-fruit aromas feed into a lightweight palate with slightly raw acidity. Snappy flavors of red currant and plum are clean, fresh and light. In a nutshell, that's what this Tupungato Pinot is about: freshness, femininity and dried red fruits. Drink through 2019.","10143":"Like most Colom\u00e9 Malbecs, this is purple in color, with concentrated aromas of rubber, herbs and jammy blackberry. A thick, almost soupy palate is chewy and cushioned, while saturated black-fruit flavors finish heavy, jammy and on the cusp of overdone.","10169":"Interesting aromas of graham cracker, pastry, blackberry, dark cherry and tomato all work well together. The palate is full and easy, with some weight to it along with flavors of black plum and berry. Not exuberant on the finish; it ends in mellow, lightly medicinal fashion.","10171":"Smells cheesy and leathery, with herbal notes. Feels condensed and flat, as if it's collapsing on itself. Flavors of baked berry and prune are dark and typical of very ripe Malbec, while the finish is warm but basic in feel and flavor. Bullish, sweet and heavy. Not Colom\u00e9's best effort, especially given the price.","10175":"Standard cherry and plum aromas create a straightforward bouquet. The feel is hot and choppy, but there's enough body and balance for it to weigh in properly. Tastes of sweet cassis, kirsch and creamy chocolate, with an oaky finish containing cocoa notes.","10214":"Woody and dense at first, this smells bright and fruity as it opens. A solid palate houses lightly toasted flavors of blackberry that turn more peppery and toasty on a fairly oaky finish.","10217":"Reduced rubbery aromas of blackberry and black currant come with a touch of mushroom. This is extracted, heavy and blocky on the palate, while baked blackberry flavors are massive but short on elegance. Bitter coffee flavors, rugged tannins and stickiness make for a heavy finish.","10222":"A direct blast of reedy cherry and cassis aromas leads to rough-charging clampy palate with high acidity and hard tannins. This tastes of rooty plum supported by bold acidity, while spice, tomato and a dusting of brown sugar are the closing flavors.","10318":"Aromas of red fruits, tomato, herbs, tobacco and cedar are stylish and not overpowering. This feels fresh and a touch earthy, with flavors of tobacco, cinnamon, cassis and baked berries. The finish is medium in length and intensity, with apparent but not overbearing oak. Drink through 2017.","10503":"Crusty, rubbery aromas smell a bit burnt, while leather and berry aromas, rest below the surface. The palate is full, edgy and a little tangy, with red plum, herb and tomato flavors. Mild and saucy tasting on the finish.","10504":"Opens with minerally, almost metallic aromas, along with rubber and berry mixed in. Feels fresh and ready, with plum, berry and chocolaty flavors. Finishes with a smooth feel, but maybe it could use a bit more cut and tannic structure. A wine that falls squarely in the middle zone.","10516":"A medicinal quality comes at you right away, followed by chocolate-coated cherry, creamy oak and a distant note of paint or chemical. Feels round and voluminous, with minty, rubbery flavors of oaky, berry and chocolate. Finishes dry and oaky, with a buttery aftertaste.","10524":"Slightly herbal plum and berry aromas come with a pinch of spice and meatiness. Feels medium-bodied and crisp, with juicy red-fruit flavors of plum, tomato and raspberry. Dries out on the finish, where it becomes more herbal and roasted.","10677":"With an opaque purple color and grapy, full aromas of blackberry Kool-Aid and cassis, this ripe Bordeaux blend is plump, chewy and a touch soft on the palate. Toasty but largely generic black-fruit flavors finish blackened, with a note of creosote, heat and drawing tannins. Drink through 2019.","10725":"This smells bland but clean, with a hint of citrus. It feels spritzy but simple, with papaya, green melon and mild citrus flavors. Good in a very basic way, but drink now before it fades.","10734":"Perfumed aromas of lemon verbena and wild flower are reminiscent of air freshener. The palate is a bit heavy, but solid acidity provides necessary cut. Flavors of vanilla and spice are a little funky, while the finish is also oaky.","10740":"A cool cherry aroma and a mild, creamy paste note open the nose. The feel is fiery and untamed, while full flavors of cherry and plum seem raw. A cocoa flavor and juicy feel define the finish.","10771":"A flat luster and mild aromas of wood and almost stale fruit get this wine off to a slow start. A full palate is sketchy in terms of acidity and balance, while this tastes cidery, with a bitter flavor of grapes skins on the finish.","10772":"Punchy citrus aromas are prickly on the nose. This wine is quite citric in feel, with lemon extract and lime taking charge.","10988":"Smooth blackberry, chocolate, violet and raisin aromas make for a complete nose. A saturated, ripe palate is a touch heavy, while heady flavors of licorice, black peppercorn and blackberry are slightly charred on a flush finish. Drink through 2022.","10999":"Exotic blueberry and cassis aromas are accented by cardamom and wild-herb scents. This Malbec from Altamira in the Uco Valley is jammy and saturated, but pure, with ripe berry, oak and spice flavors. A juicy fruit-filled finish is packed and tastes like berry compote. Lastly, a delicate herbal note gives this complexity. Drink through 2024.","11025":"Gritty aromas of grilled beef and asphalt blend with savory berry scents. Frankly, this is rough on the palate, with abrasive tannins. Savory herbal green-leaning flavors are peppery and bitter on a grabby finish.","11031":"Jumbled jammy berry aromas lack specificity. This has a forceful tartaric mouthfeel that supports tart plum and currant flavors. Keeping things consistent, this is angular and acidic on the finish, with sour plum and racy berry flavors.","11035":"A bit leafy and earthy on first take, but this also smells of roasted meat, berry fruit and menthol. It feels layered and rich, with drying tannins and full-force plum and herb flavors. This is big, dark and herbal, finishing with hints of leather, tomato and oregano.","11067":"This Cabernet Franc is superripe and oaky, with earthy, stewed and woody aromas. In the mouth, this feels grippy, resiny and dense. As it airs out, vanilla, woodspice, prune and cassis aromas come to the fore. The chocolate-tinged finish is slightly sticky in feel, exuding a strong sense of ripeness.","11226":"Baked loamy berry aromas come with a reedy rooty note of licorice. This feels good but jammy and a touch flat. Jammy raspberry, plum and currant flavors finish spicy and lightly herbal. Drink now.","11234":"Mocha and chocolate welcome you in, but once you get in there isn't much to taste. There's generic red fruit, spice and leather, but the wine seems acidified and on the razor's edge. Not overly generous and the mouthfeel is sheering.","11244":"Bubble gum on the nose makes you wonder about carbonic maceration, but that technique wasn't used to make this fruity, simple and generally nice little Cabernet. Don't expect complexity from it, or much varietal character; this is your basic red wine with adequate sweetness and some chocolate.","11424":"While this opens with harmless aromas of lychee and tropical fruits, the palate sizzles with sharp citric acidity. Flavors of pithy grapefruit and tangerine finish grabby, tart and aggressive. This is not nearly as good as the two prior vintages.","11442":"This smells rubbery and horsey at first, then earthy and ripe. It feels grabby and tannic, with rustic, leathery flavors of baked berry and cheese. Narrow and a bit dried out, this may already be past its prime in terms of vitality.","11443":"Spice, mint, herb, raspberry and currant aromas form a good nose. Things run a bit choppy and rough on the palate, but overall it works, bearing roasted berry and herb influences, with grabby tannins. This is a full, stocky, spicy and mildly green-leaning Cabernet.","11571":"After years of tasting Don David Malbecs, here's one that rises above the rest. This is jammy and stacked with brawny black-fruit aromas. The mouth is bulky and bullish, but balanced, with blackberry flavors that are coated with copious oak and end in a tornado of coffee, mocha, mint and oak. Drink now\u20132016.","11603":"Given the local competition, this Pinot Noir-dominated sparkler is pretty good. It has a peachy color along with creamy aromas that might be a little oxidized but are soft and easy nonetheless. The palate feel is frothy, while the flavors are of peach pits and underripe cantaloupe. Finishes dry and lively.","11659":"This lightly oxidized Chard is powdery but not entirely fresh, as it shows aromas of pool water and mealy melon. The palate is chunky and just O.K. in feel, while fleshy flavors of melon and peach end briny and mildly bitter.","11670":"This is dark in color and leafy smelling, with aromas of forest floor and herbal black fruits. The mouthfeel delivers a hard belt of acidity and not much else, while flavors of oaky spice and tart berry fruits are adequate but unspecial.","11675":"The nose on this clunky Torront\u00e9s suggests apricot juice and talcum powder. The palate is flat in feel, with bitter, pithy citrus flavors of grapefruit and nectarine. Beyond that there's little to it.","11679":"Chunky berry and cured meat aromas turn sweaty and herbal with airing. In the mouth, this is wholly basic. Flavors of soupy, herbal berry fruits lack definition, while the finish deals molasses and peppery bitterness.","11922":"Light in color, with transparency, something you usually don't see with Malbec. The nose is rubbery, saucy and a touch grassy, while the palate is tannic and grabby, with stewy, rustic, roasted berry flavors. Finishes with the taste of barbecue sauce.","11927":"Salinic upon opening, with thick, candied blackberry aromas along with orange peel. The wine is sincerely syrupy and rich for a value-priced Malbec, but it struggles with balance and comes across heavy, roasted and loaded down with candied berry and milk chocolate flavors.","11996":"This is minty, crusty and frankly a bit harsh on the bouquet, where aromas turn charred and burnt. It feels roasted and chunky, with hickory-smoked flavors of clove and berry. The finish vacillates between being oaky and herbal.","12007":"Foresty, rubbery and brash, this has toasty, woody, cheesy and berry-driven aromas. It feels creamy and heavy, with herbal and salty flavors that finish with a roasted, meaty taste. Warm, heavy and ponderous.","12014":"This wine is characteristic of Salta in its initial hit of patented leafy, earthy, roasted aromas and subsequent entrance of brash, grabby tannins. Nutty, roasted flavors of baked berry, toffee, coffee and earth come next.","12078":"Piattelli is an under-the-radar label that makes very good to excellent Malbec from old vines in Luj\u00e1n del Cuyo, Mendoza. And the prices are more than fair. This wine is big and focused, with intense blackberry, chocolate and espresso qualities throughout. And the finish is midnight dark. Good through 2012.","12126":"Fiery, hard and closed on the nose, this has a chemical hint. It feels acidic and sappy, with a weird mix of flavors that run from fish and fake butter to earthy, leathery raspberry. Stalky on the finish.","12278":"Bold, jumpy, reduced aromas of plum and berry fruits show little to no oak. This is chewy and jammy in feel, with standard berry flavors and almost no complexity as it heads toward a finish with mild animal and herbal notes.","12392":"Dry and medium in body, this Cab from a warm vintage is simple but friendly, with nice cassis and raspberry aromas. Juicy and lively on the palate, it holds red-fruit flavors accented by spice and herbs, particularly mint. A mild finish makes it an easy drinker.","12395":"Hard, charred oak and cedar are the lead aromas on this woody Malbec, which also shows lemon peel and blackberry on the nose. The palate is tight and pushy, mixing flavors of toasty black fruits with raw oak resin and bitter chocolate. On the finish, there's heat and even more oak.","12411":"Big aromas of blackberry and raspberry feed into a full, fresh and ultimately standard palate with grapy blackberry flavors that show a controlled herbal side. Toasty and a touch bitter on the finish, it has a minty aftertaste.","12412":"Blueberry and boysenberry aromas are deep and slightly reduced in nature. This is a chunky, wide-bodied wine with wiry acidity and more power than elegance. Flavors of roasted, toasted black fruits finish blocky and with espresso-like bitterness.","12514":"A little dusty and also sort of briney on the nose, with citric acidity pushing orange, apple and pear flavors. A textbook sweet, simple South American Chardonnay with a tropical leaning and finishing flavors of pineapple.","12515":"Opens with earthy muscle but the nose soon loses focus and freshness as it transitions to rubber and paste along with berry fruit. Hard tannins work the driving palate, while the flavors are of black plum, grape jelly and herbs. Decent but doesn't inspire.","12519":"Floral blueberry aromas are candied, artificial smelling and sweet, and the palate is supremely rich, sweet, candied and unctuous. About as thick and ripe as you get in a value Malbec, but also over the top with baked fruit and candy. Needs to be dialed back a notch.","12524":"Oily matchstick aromas run counter to the wine's innocuous color. The palate is light in weight but heavy in blossomy flavors of orange, lime, tangerine and other citrus fruits. Lacks the lychee\/tropical quality that makes Torront\u00e9s special, and finishes bitter and pithy.","12594":"This is oaky and resiny on the nose, but not overly so, with pear and apple aromas as well as a streak of saline. On the palate, this offers a good mix of oak resin, fruit pulp and acidity. Flavors of oak spice, white pepper, peach and apple finish fresh but with an oaky aftertaste.","12601":"Char and gritty scents ride heavily on the bouquet, which also shows fresher notes of cassis and raspberry. This excels via a natural feeling, pulpy palate and flavors of raspberry and red plum accented by pepper and herbs. A lightly herbal, minty finish offers length and good texture.","12645":"Sassy passion-fruit and feline aromas set up a crisp, clean-feeling palate with tangy, green, zesty flavors of scallion, lime and sour apple. A minerally, chalky finish is zingy and clean. This is nice for value-priced Sauvignon Blanc.","12652":"This Tempranillo is a heavy, saturated number with rubbery plum and berry aromas. It's totally Argentinean in style and shares little to nothing with Spanish versions; it's full bodied but not showing much in the midpalate, while generic berry flavors offer chocolate notes and finish short.","12845":"Aromas of leather, graphite, saucy berry and tomato are good but not necessarily inviting. This high-elevation Cabernet is bouncy in feel and solid in structure. Flavors of briny berry fruits come with oaky notes of vanilla and caramel, while the finish is chocolaty but quickly loses its fruit character.","13055":"A dose of cherry cough drop adds sweetness to what is otherwise a tart, simple, steely version of Cabernet Sauvignon blended with Malbec. The mouthfeel is sheering and lean, while the finish offers some out of place butter to fatten up the astringent red fruit.","13056":"The style is obtuse and the wine is sweet as sin and unctuous. Aromas of canned pear and peach suggest a lot of residual sugar.","13060":"White peach and a bit of sweat accent the expiring bouquet, while the flavors are of dull, heavy apples dotted with sauerkraut and pickle accents. Imported by Kysela Pere et Fils, Ltd.","13061":"Very sweet at first, with aromas of cherry cough drop and cr\u00e8me de cassis. Turns cheesy with air, and once the palate arrives be prepared for tangy pie cherry flavors in front of a starchy, lean finish. Offers the basics but nothing more.","13069":"An organic wine that is rough and oily on the nose and tannic and choppy in the mouth. It's a hard, wine with sweaty, sharp scents and too much black olive and funk. Not a disaster but it requires an awful lot from the buyer.","13076":"Toasty but dull, with oily walnut aromas matched by stale fruit. This is heavy and baked out; sweet and flat as a board.","13176":"Wiry, slightly volatile aromas of blackberry and cassis come with rooty notes and a mild shot of vinegar. This feels solid and creamy, with lactic oak creating chewy weight. Flavors of blackberry, vanilla and caramel are roasted and salty, while the finish tastes toasty, minty and oaky, with hard tannins.","13279":"Sassy aromas of stemmy red fruits, haystack and herbs set up a full yet raw feeling palate with herbal, gr een-leaning flavors of tart plum and raspberry. A shallow finish fades quickly.","13292":"This dark-purple Cab is full of berry, horse hide and cola aromas. It's full bodied and chunky, with herbal, mossy flavors of buttery oak, salty berry and earth. A salinic, briny flavor lingers on the beefy finish.","13300":"The nose on this Patagonian sparkler is a stand-in for Moscato, although by all indications this is made from Torront\u00e9s. The mouthfeel is smooth, with soft bubbles. Flavors of sugary white fruits, lychee and spiced pear finish sweet and short.","13419":"Tight, rooty, spicy aromas of cherry and cassis include notes of raw minerals and crushed rocks. This is a bit gritty and tannic, but it's not fierce or unyielding. Reedy, spicy plum, berry, coffee and cocoa flavors finish dry, with lasting notes of chocolate and baking spices. Drink through 2021.","13421":"Ripe, loamy blackberry, prune and cassis aromas lead to a structured palate that boasts big, firm tannins. This offers dark, ripe flavors of wild berry, black plum and chocolate prior to a toasty finish that's largely subtle and smooth. Drink through 2021.","13425":"Rubbery, slightly gritty aromas of olive and balsamic berry fruits are solid and introduce a well-balanced palate. Loamy berry and baked plum flavors are ripe and solid. Overall, this delivers an authentic taste of modern Argentina while not veering away from what's familiar; drink through 2020.","13434":"Ripe plum and berry aromas are wrapped in a bed of creamy, spicy, cheesy oak and related vanilla and tobacco scents. This is full and generous on the palate, but also a touch acidic. Plum, boysenberry and cherry flavors finish with spice, toast and blackened notes. Drink through 2021.","13435":"Composed, mossy aromas of fern, black fruits and cedar are more subtle than the palate, which is intense and a bit grating. Dark flavors of chocolate, wild berry and mocha finish with depth, integrated tannins and chocolaty richness. Drink this blend of three vineyards through 2021.","13436":"Ripe berry aromas come with a smoky accent of tree bark. This wine is extracted and brimming with black-fruit tannins. Flavors of blackberry and cassis are secure and framed by toasty, slightly burnt oak. Blocky, big and long-running on the finish; drink through 2022.","13448":"Raspberry, blackberry and tobacco aromas settle in front of a chewy, round, solidly built palate. Medicinal berry flavors come with notes of rooty spice and resiny oak. A finely oaked finish holds root beer and dark-berry flavors that smoothly fade out. Drink through 2021.","13590":"This opens with smoky, powerful aromas of black fruit and oak. The palate feels flush, offering several levels of character and complexity. Flavorwise, this pulses with blackberry, cassis and fudge, before finishing with subtle prune, mint and chocolate notes. Not edgy or hard. A blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot, Cabernet and Syrah.","13688":"Smooth, savory aromas of prune and blackberry are foresty and lightly herbal. This round-bodied Cab Franc from Tupungato is solid and balanced, with controlled tannins. Oaky flavors of plum, herbal tea and smoke finish savory. Drink through 2023; contains 15% Malbec.","13908":"This Torront\u00e9s smells round, leesy, soft and short on particular fruit aromas. Due to its age, this feels plump and low on edgy acidity. Powdery citrus and lime flavors end flat, with some burn. This is probably past its prime, but it's still in good shape to enjoy now.","13925":"A simple but reasonably good white wine. Applesauce and citrus aromas are fruity and clean, while the mango-orange palate is tasty, a little sweet and citric. Pithy on the finish but mellow overall.","13933":"Slightly baked and raisiny on the nose, with char and licorice aromas backing that up. The palate is more acidic than you'd expect, with an outsized zesty bite to go with snappy, herbal plum and cherry tomato flavors. Baked and warm on the finish.","13936":"Rosy pink and good for warm-climate getaways this winter. Bright, candied aromas are controlled and don't veer into bubblegum land, while the palate is medium soft and has just enough acid to prop up nectarine and citrus flavors. Won't last long but showing well in its early days.","13939":"Sweetly fragrant, with hints of pear and melon. The palate is wet, lean and acidic, which helps push the lychee and melon flavors. A clean, light, mild refresher with sharper-than-expected acids. Nothing more than that.","13985":"It's not often that you get the chance to try an aged Malbec for this price. The nose is sweet but also a bit soupy, while the palate is lively and delivering mature flavors of stewed cherry, cassis and raisin. Long on the finish, with brown sugar notes. A wine with finesse and restraint to drink now.","13989":"Clean and full for starters, with big berry aromas and hints of freshly poured tar as well as minerality. The palate is pure and hits the nail on the head in terms of feel. Flavors of blackberry and plum are dark and generous. Finishes with pepper, espresso and chocolate. Very good wine for the price.","13990":"A superripe style of Malbec blended with Cabernet. It's dark as midnight, with a lush bouquet and palate that ooze bulky black fruit aromas and flavors. It's compact, dense and sweet as sin, with black fruit marmalade and chocolate running the flavor profile. Finishes syrupy and with caf\u00e9 mocha flavors. Flavorful to the max but a bit too soft to be considered excellent.","14059":"Floral and dusty on the nose, this Chardonnay is racy, fruity and fairly full in body. Melon and citrus flavors are big but clean, and not much differs on the finish. Overall, this is juicy, bright and full of fruit.","14108":"Cassis and cherry aromas are raw and scratchy, but they are also pure and racy. This blend of Merlot and Cab Franc is choppy and fresh in feel, with jumpy acids propping up red currant, plum and raspberry flavors that come with oak-based vanilla. An earthy tasting, rough feeling finish is the closing act.","14338":"After a rubbery, gaseous smelling opening, things settle on standard berry aromas. The palate feels full and fresh, with zesty acidity. Flavors of rubber and generic black fruits finish solid and dark.","14341":"Compact dark-fruit aromas turn more jammy with airing. This is gripping in feel, with firm tannins. Flavors of spice, herbs and  black fruits finish with pronounced acidity, leftover tannins and a leathery accent.","14342":"While this is stout and dark up front, the nose comes with a note of stewed fruit. The thick, tannic palate is grabby and resiny in feel, while flavors of raw oak taste lactic, and the berry fruit component in the wine is loamy and feels big and blocky.","14449":"Fairly jumpy and foxy on the nose, but underneath you'll find zippy red fruit and gumball sweetness. The palate has a syrupy feel with decent tannins and a pedestrian structure. Tastes sweet, ripe and candied, with mild raisin on the finish.","14453":"Fairly round aromas of blackberry are also slightly grapey, while the plump palate offers dark fruit flavors and a choppy mouthfeel. Finishes with a taste of powdered drink mix and grape bubblegum. Decent but shows all the signs of the large-production, commercial wine that it is.","14461":"Atypical on the nose, as air freshener, berry jelly and exotic but odd aromas take over. The palate seems superficial and wholly unusual, with floral blueberry flavors and then an angular, floral finish. Not terrible but doesn't seem much like Cabernet.","14559":"Dry earthy aromas of herbal raspberry and tomato are reserved in a good way. There's acidic lift to a rugged palate, while berry fruit flavors blend with spice notes prior to a tannic finish.","14580":"Scratchy aromas of raspberry and licorice gumdrop precede a grabby, sticky palate with raw tannins. Plum and berry flavors are standard for Malbec, while the finish shows a mild baked character.","14591":"Aromas of powdered bubble gum, plum and chlorine aren't great, nor is the clamping, gritty feeling palate. With flavors of tart citrus and not much more, this is a limited but decent South American ros\u00e9.","14686":"Ripe, dense blackberry aromas are capped by creamy, toasty, chocolaty oak. In the mouth, this touches up against syrupy and cloying. Toasty oak, graphite, vanilla and milk chocolate flavors accent core blackberry, while heat and a chocolaty oak flavor drive the finish. Drink through 2020.","14734":"This comes out swinging, with bullish berry and prune aromas that hint at being stewy but then pull back. It's saturated and tannic but not rough, with black fruit, chocolate, toast and pepper flavors. Minty and dark, with a licorice note on the finish. Drink now\u20132016.","14855":"Big, meaty and dense, with dampness, earth and size. This is your typical deep and chewy wine, but the structure and core qualities are just above average. Flavors of black cherry, plum and brown sugar are good, while the finish shows a creamy vanilla flavor and cola. Good but not great for the price.","14868":"Aromas of violets, blackberry and black currant jam are solid, while the palate shows sharper acidity than most Bonardas, and thus a juicy sensation along with flavors of snappy black cherry and boysenberry. Fresh and forward, with a lot of fruit and potency.","14872":"NQN's Picada 15 line is a consistent source for good value among red wines. This four-grape blend (led by Cabernet Sauvignon) has a slight aroma of burnt leaves and tire rubber, but it settles with air into a good whole. Flavors of sweet berry fruits have an herbal edge, while the mouthfeel and finish are creamy, rich and smooth. Nice wine for the price.","14935":"The old-vines Linda vineyard Malbec is a particular wine, one that shows a high herbal, almost weedy nose that's heavy with tomato leaf. This is choppy and bumpy on the palate. Spicy red-berry and tomato flavors finish with pulling tannins and a lasting herbal character.","14957":"Generic but pleasant berry aromas are a touch powdery and dusty. This feels medium to full in body. Dry spice notes are intermixed with generic berry flavors prior to a slightly oaky, lightly minty finish.","14977":"Simple and easy to like, with cassis and cherry aromas along with a hint of earth, moss and leather. The palate is fresh, juicy and healthy, with clean, regular raspberry and ripe currant flavors. And the finish is long and mildly toasty. Good, presentable and ready to drink.","14980":"Despite being six years old, this is still kicking. The nose is raw and stewy, but it's also ripe and rubbery, with cassis and berry aromas. The palate is thick, bulky and chunky, with heavy, chewy berry fruit flavors in front of a slightly baked finish. One-dimensional but not bad for Argentine Cab.","15018":"Berry and black-plum aromas are dense. This wine from silt (limo) soils feels a bit tannic and rugged. Flavors of plum and berry fruits are spicy, while the finish is savory tasting and long, with moderate complexity. Drink through 2021.","15065":"Dry, earthy plum, cherry, tomato and leather aromas are fresh but also a touch hard and harsh. This cement-egg-fermented Cab Franc features a medium body and cutting acidity. Raw red-plum and red-berry flavors finish tight, crisp and short. Drink this juicy, monoline red through 2020.","15128":"This standard Chardonnay opens with blowsy melon and papaya aromas. The palate holds onto that melony feel while dealing honeydew, papaya and fleshy apple flavors. The finish tastes sweet and kind of flat.","15138":"Dry, leafy, herbal aromas open this wine. The palate is full and ripe in feel, with amplified extraction and herbal, leafy flavors of spiced plum and mild acidity. Things wane on the finish, which is heavy in feel but mostly just ripe and rich.","15150":"This lightly oxidized Chard is powdery but not entirely fresh, as it shows aromas of pool water and mealy melon. The palate is chunky and just O.K. in feel, while fleshy flavors of melon and peach end briny and mildly bitter.","15172":"Raspberry and cherry aromas are light and pleasing, while the palate exhibits those same friendly and inviting raspberry flavors along with some citrus. A fresh and clean wine, nothing more or less. But it manages to rise above the masses via its focus, length and purity.","15364":"Earthy, herbal, lightly leafy aromas blend with boysenberry and exotic spice notes. This Malbec-led blend is jammy and thick on the palate, with blueberry, oregano and cured-meat flavors. A solid finish holds onto the wine's core fruit and herbal notes.","15365":"Ripe, concentrated aromas of cassis and prune set up a rich palate with spicy black-fruit flavors. A loamy, meaty-tasting finish isn't complex but it is generous and jammy. This is on the cusp of being overripe but overall it weighs in as a full-flavored fruit bomb with a lot of positives.","15393":"Hard cherry and spice aromas are varietally correct, while the palate is standard in feel, with toasty, creamy flavors of sweet berry. Has enough acidity and vibrancy to rank as juicy on the finish.","15408":"Resiny oak is front and center on the nose, turning any and all fruit spicy. The palate is wet and basic, with a woody feel and oaky flavors that include spices and white fruits. Offers proper weight but smells and tastes overtly resiny.","15487":"Warm woodsy berry and prune aromas blend with notes of animal fur and mint. This is full and grabby, but not out of shape. Flavors of raisin and blackberry feature accents of charred oak and creosote, while this ends with roasted, blackened, meaty flavors, mild heat and sticky tannins. Drink through 2021.","15501":"Deep and lush up front, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cab Franc offers highly appealing aromas of blackberry and toast. Dense, layered and hefty on the palate, this extracted but well-balanced blend piles on blueberry, black plum, cassis and toast flavors. On the finish, darker notes of espresso and bitter chocolate take over. Drink now through 2018.","15582":"Solid, compact and full-bodied, with blackberry, licorice and warm asphalt on the nose. The structure is quite good and tight, while the flavors of blackberry and cassis are sweetened and softened by mocha and creamed coffee flavors. Powerful but under control, and not too complicated.","15647":"Aromas of beets and dry spice drive the harsh nose. The palate is hard and defined by bitter pepper and cherry flavors. Too much harshness and not nearly enough core fruit or cushion.","15652":"Torrontes is something we've never seen from the Trumpeter line. And maybe that's good, seeing that this is oily in the mouth, with pithy, unusual flavors coming from all directions. It's a wine that doesn't stride along with ease.","15656":"Trapiche's Broquel line has never featured Pinot Noir before, and maybe this is why. Talk about a sharp, scouring wine. It's lemony and lean, with piercing cranberry flavors and razor-sharp acidity. Crispness is one thing; sharp and edgy is another.","15803":"High Note reaches the high notes, the middle notes and the bass notes. It starts with dark berry aromas and clarity, while the palate is lively and fresh, with cherry and a light undercurrent of olive for flavors. A full, honest Malbec with size, character and balance.","15997":"Spice, licorice and herbal notes complement red-fruit aromas, while the palate offers plenty of structure and tannic grab. There's an avalanche of blackberry, cassis, fig, chocolate and herbal flavors to process, while the finish is rich and rewarding before breaking up in bits.","16125":"Stalky aromas suggest hay and green herbs, with raspberry in the backdrop. It's hot and short in terms of mouthfeel, with herbal flavors leading the way and berry fruit running behind. Dry red fruit and herbal notes dominate the finish.","16244":"This ultraripe, happy Cab Franc bursts on the scene with jammy blackberry and prune aromas. The mouthfeel is lush, almost syrupy. Flavors of ultraripe blackberry, cassis and loamy earth finish warm, lusty and with chocolate and coffee notes.","16254":"Aromas of blackberry, balsam wood, lemony oak and forest floor lead into a fully stocked, hefty palate. Flavors of black fruits, licorice, herbs and oak finish bright but level. What this lacks in complexity is made up for in ripe berry flavors and overall balance.","16296":"Dried raspberry, leather and spiced cherry aromas are basic. This has a bouncy, light mouthfeel and quick-to-dissipate flavors of dried cherry and earth. A simple finish fades fast, leving a mild raisiny aftertaste.","16304":"Dark in color with a magenta tint, this Malbec is spunky and a touch crude on the nose, with wild berry and animal fur aromas. There's angularity to the palate, which is bland in the middle. Black-fruit, herbal, savory flavors finish short on volume and complexity.","16315":"A full, oily nose with aromas of orange blossom and lychee turns more fleshy and mealy with airing. This has a plump, flush body and flavors of lime, orange and white table grapes. A citrusy finish is fruity but doesn't glide.","16326":"This friendly wine offers fresh, jammy berry and cherry aromas. The palate has a bit of grit and stickiness to it, while blackberry, black cherry and boysenberry flavors are ripe, sweet, not pushy and ultimately satisfying.","16341":"Herbal and foresty up front, this Bordeaux blend smells of fig, caramel and berry fruits. Big, tannic and chunky on the palate, this has toasty, chocolaty, burnt flavors and a blackened finish. This offers a lot of power and fruit but it's brusk.","16447":"Loud berry and oak aromas are a touch herbal. Typical for Mendoza Malbec, this is round and oaky on the palate, with related vanilla, licorice and bitter coffee flavors on top of core blackberry. A relatively smooth finish makes this well worth a go.","16450":"Ripe plum and berry aromas are supported by a full dose of smoky, savory oak. The palate is round yet jagged, while flavors of toasty, chocolaty berry fruits are also lightly herbal and heavily oaked.","16538":"Ripe, dark, baked aromas of pastry, turned-up earth, campfire and wild-berry fruits set up a seriously deep and tannic palate that's stacked with black-fruit power, toasty oak and intensity. This tastes blackened, toasty and chocolaty on top of core blackberry and cassis flavors, while an oaky finish with peppery spice is just right for this type of burly wine. Drink through 2022.","16561":"Big, full, ripe and black as night, this may be the best Apartado Gran Malbec to date. With ripe berry weight and fresh acidity, this is in fine balance. Toasty, blackened flavors of blackberry finish deep, smooth and dense. While this cuts no new ground, it's a delicious, well-made, power Malbec. Drink through 2022.","16678":"Black as night in color then lush, ripe and silky smooth on the nose, this heady Malbec offers aromas of marzipan, balsam, licorice and cassis. The palate is intense and tannic, with lusty flavors of blackberry, prune and chocolate. Finishing flavors of mocha, cocoa and toast are lush and long. Drink through 2018.","16709":"Briary and powerful smelling, with leathery aromas of blackberry and dark plum, this heavily extracted Malbec is grabby and tannic. Earthy, roasted blackberry and leathery flavors end with simmering heat. This is a big, fruity and gripping Malbec.","16754":"A blend of charred oak and violets lead the bouquet, which also offers some floral berry. The palate is lifted, medium-weight and juicy, with boysenberry and cherry flavors. Very nice if you like a floral Malbec with bright berry fruit as opposed to something dark, meaty and oaky.","16923":"Probably the best wine we've tasted from Santos Beck. This has a jammy, meaty nose accented by hard spices, while the palate is creamy and a touch brambly. Coffee, pepper and tannins work the finish. Drink now.","16928":"Waxy, round aromas are soft and properly indicate that this wine is already turning south. The palate lacks that certain Sauvignon Blanc edge but it does offer true flavors of melon, mango and orange. Full but fleshy.","17032":"Aromas of banana, tropical fruits and spun sugar set up a weighty, citrusy palate with flavors of fresh-squeezed orange juice and grapefruit. Fruity from front to back.","17047":"Orange blossom and acacia aromas are clean but mild. This has an oily feel due to modest acidity, while flavors of almond, pear and melon finish quietly before turning bitter.","17104":"Black cherry aromas are grapy and simple, with spice and forced oak notes chiming in. This feels rugged with firm tannins. Short, spicy black cherry flavors finish with a lasting burn.","17113":"Aromas of candle wax, corn and sweat are funky and oily. Speaking of oily, the texture on this Viognier is just that, while sharp acidity and heavily extracted pyrazines make this fiery. A mash-up of citrus and nectarine flavors turn slightly bitter in front of a monotonous finish.","17128":"Black fruit aromas come with spice and earth notes. This is saturated to the point of feeling heavy. Herbal raspberry and plum flavors end with grating, scratchy, unresolved tannic grab.","17132":"Cool, earthy, rooty aromas of licorice, Graham cracker, cassis and blackberry are dark and brooding. This Malbec is loosely structured, with heavy extraction and blackened, gritty flavors of blackberry and toast. A dark, rubbery, blocky finish is giant like the rest of the wine. Drink through 2022.","17135":"Lemony oak sits atop a heady bouquet supported by woody, baked-berry aromas. This is fresh and fast-moving across the palate, with rooty, toasty flavors of baked black fruits. A peppery, toasty, chocolaty finish is solid, dense and layered. Drink through 2021.","17194":"Citrus peel, melon and peach aromas are ordinary. This feels pithy and citric, while flavors of white grapefruit and underripe stone fruits finish almondy and bitter.","17195":"Stalky, oaky and rustic on the nose, this is a creamy, woody, resiny Malbec with oak-based flavors of plastic and vanilla along with slightly stewed, baked fruit. Clove and medicinal flavors are prominent on the finish.","17197":"This salmon-colored, no-dosage bubbly is peachy, dusty and yeasty on the nose, with strong whiffs of sulfur and scrambled egg. A clunky, foamy palate comes across as clumsy, while peach and melon flavors are a touch bitter and mealy. Papaya and savory barbecued notes drive the finish, which has a bitter element.","17206":"Sulfur, burnt matchstick and powdered sugar aromas make up the bouquet. This Malbec-derived sparkler is round and full, with a light bubble bead. Heavy, sweet-tasting stone-fruit flavors finish melony and sugary sweet.","17214":"The palate shows modest citric acidity which sets up a flavor profile of sulfur, grapefruit and tangerine. Pyrazines and bitterness run roughshod on the finish.","17215":"Aromas of tomato leaf, baked beans and stewed plum set up a narrow, pinched palate. Flavors of herbal raspberry and red plum have a green, minty component that starts early and carries onto a dry, raw finish.","17219":"Rubbery, medicinal aromas suggest iodine and latex. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is heavy and flabby, with baked, herbal flavors that finish saucy and show notes of tomato and fennel.","17259":"The citrusy red-fruit aromas have a sharp note of brine. It feels broad and full, with sweet berry and plum flavors, while snappy raspberry flavors and scratchy tannins work the finish.","17312":"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.","17604":"Black cherry and blackberry aromas are ripe, with a touch of prune weighing in. In the mouth, punchy acidity sticks out. Wiry raspberry and plum flavors are surprisingly tart and underdeveloped, while lactic oak notes and choppy acidity make for a jumbled finish.","17680":"Sweet black fruit aromas come with notes of animal hide, brown sugar, prune and fern. Feels good but a touch scratchy and acidic, with dark spice, ample barrel influence, vanilla and blackberry flavors. Tastes minty and fades quickly on the finish.","17686":"Hailing from Salta, this is a concentrated, fully oaked Tannat with deep red berry aromas topped with lemony oak, pencil lead and coconut. Feels tight as a box of nails, with zingy acidity framing tangy raspberry, currant, woodspice and peppery flavors. Aggressive stuff that requires airing and food.","17689":"With ripe aromas of cough syrup, baked berry, cherry and smoke, this Malbec offers a bit of everything. The palate is full but has energy, and the flavors of boysenberry, blueberry and chocolate come in a big, pounding wave. Finishes chunky and jammy, with adequate freshness.","17729":"Horsey, overripe aromas don't convey a sense of balance. As the nose indicates, this comes across heavy and syrupy, with blocky tannins. Stewy flavors of blackberry and prune finish with hard tannins.","17736":"Extremely oaky and resiny, this offers aromas of wood grain, resin, vanilla and sawdust that crowd out any fruit that might seek to escape. The palate feels heavy and resiny, with flavors of wood, vanilla and coconut, but again almost no fruit. This is 70% Chardonnay and 30% S\u00e9millon.","17747":"Herbal berry aromas come with a note of asphalt before veering toward eucalyptus. The palate is acidic, so much so that it pushes the wine's flavors toward salty and tart. Generic berry flavors pop up on the finish once the wine's tartaric acidity subsides.","17750":"Strong berry and horsey aromas set the stage for a fruity palate braced by a shot of acidity. Blackberry flavors are a touch funky and finish hot and big.","17751":"Dense berry aromas are a bit flat and medicinal. Expect a juicy, direct palate with hard plum and berry flavors that are also a touch briny\/salty. A full finish loses its fruit fast, leaving ringing acidity and a lasting briny flavor.","17777":"The Alta Vista single-vineyard wines are among the best in Argentina. This offers a soft, deep, alluring nose with plum, berry, minerality and a hint of rubber and bacon. It's rich, pure and a bit jammy in feel, with saturated blueberry, blackberry, molasses and caramel flavors. A cuddly, long finish confirms this Malbec's outstanding status. Drink through 2018.","17803":"With a bouquet packed with pure blackberry, boysenberry, chocolate, baking spice and minerally aromas, this immediately registers as excellent Malbec. The palate, like almost all Cobos heavyweight Malbecs, is smooth and layered. Flavors of meaty blackberry, exotic spices and chocolate yield to a polished, elegant finish that's earthy and delicious. Drink now through 2017; 275 cases produced.","17917":"Loamy, ripe berry aromas come with leather and raisiny notes. This blend of five grapes is heavy, tannic and weighty, but not overtly out of balance. Stewed berry and raisiny flavors are as ripe as they can get and still stay somewhat fresh, while the finish is raisiny. Overall this is a one-dimensional, fully ripe wine.","17922":"Dark in color, this chunky, ripe Malbec opens with blackberry, earth and rubber aromas. That bold, full quality carries onto the palate, which is staunch and bullish, with pepper and berry flavors that finish dry, yet weighty and lush.","18022":"Open-grain oak aromas are out front, followed by sweeter scents of marzipan, prune and chocolate. A full, tannic palate is deep and dense, while toasty blackened flavors of cassis and blackberry finish with notes of mocha, chocolate and pepper. This is a bit rough and tannic, so cellaring will help it calm down. Drink through 2023.","18165":"Root beer, marzipan and wood-accented berry aromas lead to a pleasant, medium-bodied palate with cassis and blackberry flavors that are robust at first but hollow out with time. Toast, dark chocolate and herbal flavors ride high on a fresh, driving finish.","18260":"Opens with red fruit aromas that are like a million other generic red wines, while the body has size, grab and stickiness. Flavors of cola, cherry, cassis and plum are red in nature and basically good, while the finish is candied but not overly so. An everyman's Cabernet in every sense of the word.","18531":"Forward berry aromas are regular but solid. The palate has a ripe but choppy mouthfeel and juicy, firm flavors of blackberry and dark toast. Burns a bit on the finish, with extended toasty flavors and peppery accents.","18533":"Standard-issue berry and plum aromas turn warm and leathery with airing. The palate on this Malbec-Bonarda-Syrah blend is juicy, but it comes with a choppy feel. Tastes brambly and wild, with red berry fruit and a briary, leathery finish.","18534":"Chunky and oily on the nose, with basic white fruit aromas of peach and apple. The palate is full and balanced, with nectarine, pineapple and lychee flavors. Pithy and citrusy on the finish. Ripe and good in a regular way.","18545":"Quite minty and herbal on first take, with a hardness to the bouquet. The palate is racy, herbal, roasted and very much tastes different than most Argentine wines because it's from Cafayate in the north; look for spice, tomato, herbal waves and meaty notes.","18655":"This is tan in color, with a flat, murky nose of stone-fruit aromas and chemical harshness. A round, oily textured palate tastes of briny nectarine and pithy bitterness. In many ways, this is like sucking on a peach pit.","18659":"Damp, earthy cherry aromas and saucy plum notes amount to a rocky opening. A grabby, drying, tannic palate and wiry plum flavors end with burnt overtones, a drawing feel and bitterness.","18663":"Leafy aromas of tomato and green herbs pile on the pyrazines. This distinctly herbal Cabernet is full and chunky in feel, with flavors that follow the nose: bell pepper and spicy tomato lead the way. A peppery finish is herbal to the last note.","18668":"Rustic, rubbery, leathery aromas are highly suggestive of animal hide and stalky berry fruits. This is hard as rocks on the palate, with an astringent mouthfeel. Briny, leathery berry and plum flavors end with a stalky aftertaste.","18676":"Stewy, muddled, herbal aromas come prior to a chunky, chewy palate. Flavors of compost, nutty berry fruits and turned earth lack freshness, while a stewed finish tastes mulchy and feels tannic.","18696":"Roasted, savory, earthy berry ?aromas come with a spot of leafy green on this Malbec. The palate is saturated and a touch narrow in feel, while flavors of black cherry, cassis, baked blackberry and cured meat finish with creamy oak notes and a strong hint of bacon. Drink through 2018.","18876":"A blend of Malbec, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon with lightly herbal red fruit aromas that come across reedy and foxy. Lively and a little scratchy in the mouth, with raspberry and buttery plum flavors. Shows more than adequate freshness and pulse, but breaks apart when held up to higher scrutiny.","18884":"Dark and sweet smelling, with marzipan, coconut, licorice and black fruit aromas. Surprisingly clacky and tartaric feeling, with oak-slathered berry flavors that are both baked and racy. Shows flashes of quality flavors, but the mouthfeel and overall balance are just o.k.","19292":"Rich, oaky and earthy, with char to the bouquet. A little tannic and beefy, but with serious grip and feel. Tastes like savory, herb-infused berry and plum, while the finish is herbal, long and solid. Nice wine with an herbal streak and staunch tannins.","19336":"For the price you can't go wrong with a wine like this. It's flowery and fruity, and beyond that it doesn't pretend to be more than it is. There's a natural creaminess to the feel and full melon and white fruit flavors. Proof that some Chardonnays do better without oak.","19502":"A jammy, tarry wine with aromas of leather, candy, licorice, mint and herbs. The palate has a solid, round feel and herbal flavors that hint at anisette, black cherry and chocolate mint. A bit sticky and thick but nice and generous.","19536":"Sappy volatile berry and plum aromas lead to sharp citric palate. This tastes of sour plum and herbs, while oaky spice and clove notes rise up on the finish.","19554":"Grassy floral aromas are aromatic but unrefined. This sparkling Chardonnay tastes of lime and wild flowers, with bitterness to the back end of the flavor profile. A sulfuric note of scrambled egg rises up on a bitter finish.","19564":"Flat to start, with oaky aromas of mustard and clove, this feels round, with citric acidity and a sense of wood grain to the palate. Barrel-driven flavors of salty melon and mustard end with grainy resiny oak notes.","19568":"Grapy aromas suggest minerals and iodine along with wet animal fur and plum. It's firm and tannic on the palate, with herbal, rooty plum and berry flavors and a tight finish.","19573":"Uncommon exotic blueberry aromas are lean and grassy. In the mouth, this is high in acidity and scouring. Flavors match the nose, meaning this tastes sour and exotic, while the finish is sharp and scrubbing.","19574":"Stewed, saucy aromas of grassy tomato and herbal berry fruits are foxy. This feels cutting and rough, while minty green-berry flavors come with a note of animal fur.","19614":"Phebus is a new label from Fabre Montmayou, and frankly this wine has issues. It smells a lot like gumballs and a wet, dirty dog. It doesn't have much substance or flow, and that gamy, wet-dog character is persistent, even on the flavor profile.","19712":"Overall this Tocai is fairly good from start to finish. Apple and matchstick aromas lead to a wide palate. Apple, peach and persimmon flavors show a bit of salt and finish short.","19713":"Tea, tomato, baking spice and briny red-plum aromas lead to a creamy, almost candied palate. Flavors of plum and dried cherry carry plenty of oak plus pepper and spice notes. Finishing flavors of cocoa, nutmeg and clove are derivative of barrel aging.","19726":"Lean, largely neutral citrus aromas set up a palate with medium weight. Melon, pineapple and passion-fruit flavors are fresh but minimal. A bright finish makes this a good match for ceviche.","19763":"This wine needs air in order to get at its dark-fruit aromas. In the mouth, this blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cab Franc is ripe but smacks down hard with tannins. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and herbs end with complex notes of graphite and chalk. This gets better the more time you spend with it. Drink through 2024.","19770":"Ripe, concentrated blackberry, cassis, oak and graphite aromas set up a burly palate that's stacked to the max. An oak-based note of popcorn sits atop a heavy palate with deep black-fruit and graphite flavors. An oaky finish with salty blueberry and cassis flavors is bolstered by fresh acidity. Drink through 2022.","19776":"Heady aromas of olive and balsamic blackberry come with touches of rubber and road tar in front of a dense, well-groomed palate that doesn't bite or overpower. Ripe blackberry, toast and baking spice flavors end with warmth and clarity. Drink through 2019.","19777":"Earthy notes of olive and leather are part of the bouquet along with licorice and blackberry scents. This Petit Verdot is fully mature but still vital and lively. Tannic and deep on the palate, this tastes of blackberry, vanilla and chocolate. A ripe but not overly demanding finish confirms that this is ready to drink.","19855":"This is pricey for what you get. It's a blend of 50% Riesling with 40% Albari\u00f1o and 10% Sauvignon, and frankly it smells a bit oily and stalky, while the palate is soft and the flavors suggest underripe green melon and apple. On the finish, it's a bit green.","19861":"Almost citrusy aromas of candied berry are jammy and unconvincing. The mouth is narrow and pinched in feel, with herbal, wiry berry flavors that finish minty and hot.","19869":"Smoky and dark, with serious aromas of black licorice, earth and lush berry. The palate has a great feel to it along with huge flavors of cassis, blackberry, black peppercorn, coffee and sweet coconut. It's stellar from front to back, with coffee, mocha and silky tannins on the finish. Composed of 60% Malbec with 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and small parts Tannat and Petit Verdot. Drink now through 2013.","19885":"Fruity, floral and calm on the nose, with nothing aggressive or out of place. The palate is deep, flush and offers great mouthfeel, while the flavors run toward big, juicy berry, cassis and chocolate. Like most Catena high-enders, this Cabernet-Malbec blend features a toasty finish of coffee and mocha, and overall it's stylish and impressive. Drink now through 2014.","19936":"This starts out with textbook aromas of red and black fruits that are pure and easy to get into. It shows kick on the palate, with oaky flavors of coffee and chocolate that accent ripe berry and mild herb notes. It's toasty and spicy on the finish, with a gritty feel.","20059":"This rosado smells of red apple cider, red licorice candy and cotton candy. It's full on the palate, with helpful acidity. Flavors of grapefruit and orange are limited, but overall this ros\u00e9 of Malbec makes the grade.","20060":"Brandied cherry aromas are a touch stalky and hot, but overall this opens well. Edgy in feel, this Cab shows baked berry flavors and scratchy acidity in front of a stalky, roasted tasting finish.","20066":"Nervy cranberry and grainy-oak aromas struggle to achieve cohesion on the nose. Flavors of buttery oak, green herbs and berry fruits finish with herbaceous notes and a flabby feel.","20070":"Leafy, herbal aromas of spicy berry fruits lean toward green. An edgy, acidic palate delivers herbal flavors of currant and plum, while the finish is spicy and herbal, much like a good tomato sauce.","20100":"Extracted, grapy aromas suggest raisin and prune but this wine is not overtly overripe. In the mouth, it is grabby and a bit raisiny. Rich, heady flavors of mocha, fig and prune finish with chunky weight. Drink through 2020.","20250":"A pitch-black color is a good indication of the power and concentration this old-vine Malbec has in store. Aromas of blackberry, fir forest and ink set up an over-the-top-rich palate, with heavy extraction and giant flavors of minty blackberry and chocolate. Pull out the knife and fork to cut through the deep, chocolaty finish. Drink now through 2017.","20360":"Raspberry and rubber-band aromas lead to a saturated palate with full tannnins and flavors of plum and plum skins. A mildly hot finish with grapeskin residue maintains the high volume this Malbec is putting out.","20397":"Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are toasty at first, then charred as this breathes. A big grabby palate is muscled up but welcoming. Toasty blackberry and cassis flavors remain charred on a loaded lengthy finish. This is Malbec and Petit Verdot fermented and aged together. Drink through 2022.","20603":"Leather, blueberry, blackberry and mild herbal notes make for a rich, ribald bouquet. Given the nose, it's no surprise that this Malbec is dense, jammy and a bit oversaturated in the mouth. Flavors of blackberry, prune, mint and graphite finish with lushness. Drink now through 2016.","20639":"This opens with a gaseous, sulfuric scent followed by aromas of peach pit, apricot, green apple and wet stones. The palate is lean and zesty, while flavors of lemon, tangerine and nectarine finish with a blend of raw acidity and oaky vanilla.","20665":"Clean, fresh, stony aromas are basic but good. A round palate benefits from citric kick, while this tastes of mixed tropical fruits backed by skins-based bitterness.","20806":"Hard and capped on the bouquet, with plastic aromas, dry oak, milk chocolate and mint. Feels resiny and cloying, with wood-led flavors and resin. Tastes bland and overoaked for what it is.","20808":"Gaseous, oily and flowery on the bouquet, with lemon and apple notes. Feels round and adequately acidic, with stalky, burnt flavors of lemon and melon. Short and rough on the finish.","20811":"Moscato-like with its jasmine and lychee aromas, but things fall apart in the mouth. It's overly foamy and active, with bland flavors that lack the powdery, floral elements that can make Torront\u00e9s good. Gaseous on the finish.","20815":"For the price, this is not a good effort. It's overoaked and horsey smelling, with a heavy, overripe palate that tastes herbal and like hickory-infused blackberry. Flat and stewy on the finish.","20823":"Rusty in color, with rubbery, chemical aromas. Feels tight, tannic and clampy, with hard, compromised flavors and bitterness to the finish. Astringent and just not that appealing.","20825":"Woody and baked up front, its cooked, rubbery aromas setting set up a surprisingly sheer and sharp palate that's short on substance and balance. Tastes generic, with linear acidity resulting in little cushion or mouthfeel.","20921":"Citrus and stone-fruit aromas struggle to hold up, while the palate on this blend of 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay is solid but soft. Flavors of apple cider, peach juice and yeasty bread shift to powdered sugar and white table grapes on the finish.","20936":"Smoky aromas of bacon and rubber lead the charge. The palate is good and ripe, with roasted berry, molasses and tangy acidity that's reflected via a lemony note. The finish has bite and shear to it along with flavors of olive and green herbs. Drink now.","21075":"Soft, bland aromas of applesauce and herbaceous green fruits lead to a jumbled, acidic palate that's awkward and scouring. Green flavors of lime and grass finish tangy.","21076":"Flowery, tropical aromas might have you thinking this is Torront\u00e9s. The palate is flimsy and dilute, with lychee and pyrazine-driven flavors that tail off in bitter fashion.","21084":"This opens with off-putting aromas of cinnamon and air freshener. On the palate, this is chewy and creamy, with a ton of oak and jammy, baked berry flavors that finish sticky.","21091":"Rough and rugged is the best way to describe this Malbec. Earthy, woody, rubbery berry aromas lead to a sharp, high-acid palate. Wiry, fiery plum-like flavors stay fierce and pick up heat on the finish.","21092":"Candied, dusty aromas turn sweet and soapy if given time. The sugary feel to the palate stops just short of cloying, while candied raspberry, watermelon and brown sugar flavors end with milk chocolate and sweet red-fruit notes.","21093":"Leathery, rubbery aromas are pinched, stalky and unripe. This Patagonian blend is drawing and astringent, with bland, cool-climate red-berry flavors that have an herbal streak. Saucy, tannic and heavy on the finish, this ends with a note of salami and fennel.","21183":"Roasted, gritty aromas of bacon and spicy oak are burnt on the surface. This is fleshy and full in body, with moderate acidity. Herbal, minty, lightly green berry flavors have a rooty accent and oaky makeup. Finishing flavors of mint and raw oak blend into herbal berry leftovers.","21188":"Aromas of oak, mint and cola accent earthy black-fruit scents in front of a palate that's tannic and raw but firm and structured. Berry and salty, oaky flavors finish with grabby, drying tannins and peppery spice.","21198":"Citrusy aromas suggest white grapefruit. Plump but balanced in feel, this tastes a bit salty and briny, maybe a reflection of its partial coastal grapes, something that's new to Argentina. The briny tangy finish is interesting.","21298":"A big, warm style of Chard. The nose is soft, toasty and loaded with butter, baked apple and vanilla aromas. Feels full, round and creamy, while oak sits at the forefront of the flavor profile, with toast, apple and vanilla lurking behind. Finishes sweet and smooth. 400 cases made.","21302":"Opens with aromas of black cherry and waves of resiny oak. Has good body and grabby barrel tannins along with a palate that deals dark berry flavor and even more oakiness. Tastes resiny and saucy on the finish; cleans up as it airs.","21309":"Smells sort of furry and earthy initially, with notes of graphite and woodspice. Feels narrow and grabby, with pointed acididty framing red plum, cherry and lightly oaky, minty flavors. Fits the definition of good but regular Malbec.","21372":"Giant and black, with extracted but pruney aromas that are sweet and raisiny. The palate is chunky, with raisin, fig and black plum flavors. Sweet but falls flat on the finish; has its good qualities but frankly it's an overripe wine.","21373":"Opens with earthy, leafy aromas that can best be described as \u201cmature.\u201d Throw in tobacco and baked plum, and the picture is complete. The palate is concentrated and tight, with sweet, herbal berry flavors and caramel on the finish. Rugged and herbal as a whole but with good qualities; 50% Cabernet with 40% Merlot and 10% Malbec.","21375":"Blackberry and other sweet aromas lead to a soft, mildly oaky palate with sweet, ripe plum and berry flavors. There's juicy acids and reasonable amounts of toast, licorice and spice on the finish. Not sure what differentiates this from Reserve, but the Barrel Select seems better balanced.","21378":"Cherry, sweet berry and citrus peel aromas come in front of a full, slightly oaky palate with sweet plum and berry flavors. There's some length to the finish and more flavors of sweet, creamy but nicely applied oak.","21386":"Meaty, herbal aromas are a bit rooty and mossy but with time they offer up berry fruit and spice. The palate is full and plump, and also a little hard and tannic, while the flavors suggest prune and cassis. Spicy and with good feel to the finish.","21445":"A year or two ago when Paul Hobbs began consulting for Toso things changed for the better. This is the rare Best Buy that can swim with the big fish and give them a run for the money. Pop the cork and enjoy lusty dark aromas of Turkish tobacco and berry compote. In the mouth, there's a riot of fruit flavors to ponder followed by a smooth, lusty finish.","21453":"Heavily toasted and loaded with black cherry and blackberry aromas, this blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Petit Verdot pushes cola, chewy plum and black-fruit flavors. The back end is all about coffee, mocha and bitter chocolate, and as a whole this wine shows Argentina in a fine light. As for the winery, Chakana almost always gets it right.","21465":"Amancaya, a blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, never fails to impress. This wine is rich and controlled but also alert and upright. It is juicy and succulent, with ripe blackberry and cassis at its base. Finishes tight and long, and sports a fine structure throughout.","21789":"Dark in color, with smoky aromas of clove and toasted blackberry, this Malbec is saturated on the palate, with a grapy texture. Flavors of charred oak, burnt toast and blackberry finish peppery and stout, with a stewy aftertaste.","21794":"Spice and dusty fruit aromas are equalized by saucy, funky, leafy notes. This is full in the mouth, with flavors of brown sugar, baking spices and baked cherry. This finishes with mild spice and oak flavors.","21797":"A bulky, full-fruited nose is creamy and floral in character. The palate is heavy, thick and sticky, with flavors of molasses and ripe black fruits. Pepper, mint and chocolate flavors vie with big tannins on the finish.","21798":"Aromas of blueberry and boysenberry are active and come with a whiff of animal fur. This feels chunky but not to the point of collapsing on itself. Flavors of plum, blackberry and juniper finish with clove notes and mild bitterness.","21836":"Dusty peach and nectarine aromas are subtle and draw you toward a balanced palate with modest weight and natural-feeling acidity. Peach, melon and quince flavors finish firm and elegant. This wine has a French character to it.","21840":"Earth, leather, black plum and wild-berry aromas are solid and appealing. This is wide and jammy in the mouth, with all the volume expected of Argentinean Malbec. Flavors of oak, mint and spiced plum finish with a touch of heat. Drink through 2018.","21854":"Barrel-related aromas of caramel, popcorn and baked pear dominate the nose, while the palate brings notes of citrus zest, with lively minerality and cutting acidity. This chiseled Chardonnay tastes like tart nectarine, green apple and lime, while the finish is tight as a drum. Drink through 2022.","22093":"Fresh, fruity cherry, citrus and rose aromas are light and airy. This feels a bit raw and scratchy, while currant, red plum and brown sugar flavors finish juicy, snappy and uncushioned. This has all the requirements of a good picnic Pinot Noir.","22112":"Gritty berry and plum aromas are blocky. This feels choppy, almost rocky, while baked berry flavors ramble towards a spicy, sappy finish with stewed fruit notes and some residual heat.","22128":"Like most Colom\u00e9 Malbecs, this is purple in color, with concentrated aromas of rubber, herbs and jammy blackberry. A thick, almost soupy palate is chewy and cushioned, while saturated black-fruit flavors finish heavy, jammy and on the cusp of overdone.","22289":"Woody aromas are obvious but not overdone as they dominate apple and banana notes. This Chardonnay is narrow and grabby in feel, with salty orange and popcorn flavors. As modest fruit flavors fade on the finish, oak resin takes over.","22397":"Solid and broad on the nose, with black cherry, berry and controlled rubbery aromas. Fresh, juicy and healthy on the palate, with good drive and dark, toasty flavors of black fruits, spice and chocolate. Spicy, warm and a bit complex on the finish. Malbec with Cab Sauvignon and Syrah; drink now.","22417":"Earthy berry aromas are complex due to side notes of crushed leaves, charred meat and burnt wood. This single-vineyard Malbec is juicy and loaded with energy as a result of racy acidity. Plum, wild berry, herb and spice flavors finish dry, firm and focused. Drink this high-toned Malbec through 2025.","22418":"Big aromas of blackberry, leather, turned earth and white mushroom set up a bright, layered palate with fresh acidity at its core. Floral, exotic red-berry flavors are spicy and in sync with each other. A crisp, peppery finish with toasty oak ensures that this single-vineyard Malbec is built to last. Drink through 2025.","22743":"Bold Malbec with aromas of berry liqueur, cassis and black cherry. The palate is fresh in feel, with some edginess and snappy acids. Tastes full of berry fruit, creamy oak and vanilla, while the finish is round, lengthy and big. A little oaky and forced, but nice as Malbec goes.","23005":"Tan in color, with dry lightly oxidized aromas as well as notes of white pepper and peach pit, this white Pinot Noir is low on fruit and feels tight, acidic and raw. Tart apple and sour lemon flavors include a note of fino Sherry, while this closes with a steady beam of sharp acidity.","23044":"Ripe, deep aromas of cassis and marzipan evolve to show minerality. A big, chunky palate features flavors of baked blackberry, cassis and chocolate, while a mild, somewhat languorous finish is chewy and leaves a lasting taste of prune. Drink now through 2018.","23047":"Aromas of pencil lead and lemony oak vie with jammy, raisiny scents. This is a live-wire wine with energy flowing across a jumpy palate. Ripe cassis and blackberry flavors show a licorice note, while the finish is concentrated at first before breaking up and showing some heat. Drink through 2018.","23067":"Aromas of balsam wood, marzipan and ripe blackberry are focused and generous. Chewy tannins hold the palate together, while flavors of herbal, spicy cassis and black plum come with chocolate and baking spice notes before finishing thick but focused. Drink through 2018.","23121":"Aromas of wild berry and animal hide unfold on the nose. In the mouth, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot is heady and offers tons of berry and cassis fruit. The finish is rich and borderline syrupy, with thickness and depth but not a lot of complexity.","23127":"This is typically full, dark and rich, with balsamic aromas of roasted berry and leather. A tannic mouthfeel runs deep and dense, while flavors of licorice and baked black fruits finish with a heavy dose of chocolate along with a syrupy feel.","23144":"This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend opens with oaky, medicinal aromas of mint and cherry candy. The palate is fairly full but raw in feel, while scratchy, long-running flavors of leather and earth accent core red fruit. Licorice and mint lead an oaky finish.","23182":"A toasty, leathery, baked-fruit bouquet is sultry and includes hints of popcorn and caramel. In the mouth, this is tannic and full-bodied, with flavors of bacon, hickory smoke, blackened spices and blackberry as the canvas. Minty, dark and oaky on the finish, with heat.","23183":"Rich, heady aromas of black fruits, oaky char and caramel are lusty and modern. In the mouth, this shows a bolt of acidity that creates energy but also strains the wine's balance. Baked blackberry, chocolate, pepper and vanilla flavors finish long, ripe and oaky, with length derived from lasting acidity. Drink through 2021.","23197":"Cherry and plum aromas are ripe, sweet and inviting. There's plenty of body and roundness to this Bonarda, while exotic blueberry and boysenberry flavors finish fresh, with a light herbal aftertaste. Overall this shows lots of fruit and good balance.","23211":"Cola, blackberry and dusty aromas amount to something nice and inviting. Cab Franc is new to the Broquel lineup, and this is lush, bold and fruity in style, with blackberry, black cherry and mocha flavors in front of a toasty, full-throttle finish.","23218":"Deep, ripe, smooth blackberry, prune, cola and earth aromas are elegant and harmonious. This small-lot Malbec (50 cases made) shows ripeness and freshness on the palate as well as lightly roasted blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. A firm, dry, on-the-money finish is the final note in this wine's well-sung chorus. Drink through 2018.","23220":"Laser-like cassis and black cherry aromas come with an accent of toasted oak. A pure, well-balanced palate isn't at all pushy or heavy, while snappy, fresh flavors of raspberry and spiced plum finish racy, toasty and the slightest bit herbal. Drink through 2022.","23230":"This is the best Enemigo Cabernet Franc to date. It's pure, heady, powerful juice with integrated smoky oak and spice aromas. Pure in the mouth, this is dense and full of quality. Blackberry and chocolate flavors are ripe and modern in style, while the finish is full, leathery, a touch salty and savory. Drink through 2019.","23308":"Shows some nice qualities such as barrel notes of popcorn and buttered toast, but overall the wine is too soft and tropical to rate higher. The palate is plump, fruity and flush, but also low in acid and soft. Flavorwise, it's pure tropical fruit with a hollow finish.","23309":"Unusual aromas of pine needle, cough drop and herbal berries set the stage for a juicy, tight palate with raspberry, red plum and herbal flavors. Medium in length and intensity, with a smooth finish that leaves a solid, generally positive lasting impression.","23318":"Small-production (300 cases total) SB from high-elevation vineyards with solid apple and citrus aromas. Basic but clean, with lemon, orange, grapefruit and nectarine flavors. Good for Argentina, which doesn't have much of a track record with Sauvignon Blanc. Drink now.","23458":"Sweet and candied on the nose, it has a touch of citrus and melon to the flavor profile. It has an okay mouthfeel.","23461":"It's oxidized and nutty on the nose. The palate is peachy, while flavors of nuts, dried-out citrus and baked stone fruits finish bland.","23481":"Candied plum and red berry aromas smell like red licorice. Flavors are raisiny, with sourness and astringency.","23494":"Inviting raspberry and cherry aromas have a tiny level of volatility, while the palate is chunky, bold and edgy, with big berry flavors leading the way. Full on the finish, with some oak and vanilla to give it padding. Lively, full-bodied Cabernet that's pretty good in the long run.","23505":"Floral, oily aromas are offset by the scents of lychee and lime. The palate is tropical and tasty, with peach, lychee and persistent freshness. It's getting a little heavy and lazy at this point in its development, but it's an honest reflection of northern Argentinean Torront\u00e9s.","23594":"A tough sell at this price. The nose is minty, green and smells of tobacco, spice and fern fronds, while the palate is tangy, clangy in feel and dry. Flavors of semisour, herbal cherry and plum are touched up by sweet oak, but overall it's rather dry and scouring.","23607":"Brickish in color, and seemingly thin. Aromas of baked fruit, compost, tobacco, vanilla and burnt coffee are challenging, while the palate is earthy and tastes leafy as well as sweet. On the positive side, it's neither heavy nor overdone. On the negative side, it's thin and on the fade.","23645":"Earthy, leafy plum and berry aromas hint at compost. This is fresh, juicy and bright on the tongue, with berry and cassis flavors that are peppery and herbal. A thorough, lasting finish is mellow as it displays absorbed, smooth tannins. Drink through 2022.","23648":"Ripe, heady, slightly malty aromas of blackberry and plum set this on its way. In the mouth, there are scratchy, unresolved tannins and acidity to deal with along with salty flavors of oak, plum and cassis. A lasting, oaky finish with vanilla and butter notes provides for a good close out. Drink through 2020.","23663":"Mossy, lightly herbal blackberry aromas are complex and include notes of cedar and licorice. This feels solid and gritty, with manageable but serious tannins. Flavors of ripe blackberry, cassis and peppery spice finish chocolaty and oaky. This is excellent New World Cabernet even if it's not charting any new pathways. Drink through 2021.","23764":"Spiced apple, raw oak and related cinnamon and woodspice aromas introduce a flush, chunky palate that's showing modest acidity. Flavors of savory oak, tropical fruits and baked apple finish creamy in feel, with flavors of papaya and vanilla.","23765":"Violet and berry aromas are pleasant, fresh and not too demanding or loud. This is solid in feel, maybe a bit simple overall, with plum, berry and a touch of char making up the flavor profile. Generic berry flavors and a dry feel define the finish.","23782":"Blueberry and plum aromas are slightly exotic but also unusual and wayward. An easy feeling palate is medium in body and intensity, while woody flavors of herbal blueberry finish mild, with a persistent herbal aftertaste.","23785":"Strawberry, field grass and creamy, lactic aromas feed into a bright palate with ripe but short flavors of melon and spiced apple. This is dry and dusty on the finish, with fresh acidity and a touch of powdered sugar flavor.","23808":"The nose on this 50-50 blend is piercing, with dark cherry, black plum and mild herbal aromas running the show. The mouthfeel is focused and fresh, and the flavors of cherry, raspberry, plum and chocolate soften and spread out on the finish as oaky vanilla and herbal echoes take over.","23828":"Black-fruit aromas are accented by notes of licorice, green herbs and grass. This is full and chunky, but a bit hollow in mouthfeel. Pronounced tartaric acidity results in surface-level pop along with hollowness, while lactic oak and coconut flavors on the finish are familiar for Argentine Cabernet.","23837":"Dark, ripe, tarry aromas announce a macho Malbec. This is jammy and pulpy in texture, with more than enough extraction. Herbal, woodsy black-fruit flavors are supported by an oaky, resiny finish with black-pepper spice notes. Drink through 2018.","23842":"Fully ripe, almost stewy aromas of raisin, prune and blackberry are soft and friendly. That's more or less the theme with this wine; the palate is cushioned and dense, while a loamy set of jammy berry and chocolate flavors finish with raisiny sweetness and a licorice note.","23860":"Wiry raspberry and plum aromas put this in the red-fruit category. A loud, tannic, expansive palate blazes with acidity, while fully toasted oak gives this a burnt element to match raspberry and red-plum flavors. Hard tannins and bold acidity make for a long, rugged finish.","23868":"Ripe blackberry and cola aromas comes across as foresty and nice as a whole. This saturated, dense Malbec shows brutish, choppy tannins along with flavors of blackberry, exotic spices and fig. The finish remains rough and turns hot. Drink through 2021.","23881":"Tropical-fruit aromas of lychee and passion fruit come with a hint of lanolin. This wine feels citrusy, with fresh passion fruit and tangerine flavors that are not oily or gritty on the finish.","23893":"Roasted plum and tomato aromas are spicy but hard and gritty. That also describes the mouthfeel on this narrow, linear Malbec with beaming acidity. Plum and berry flavors finish direct, with no interference from heavy oak.","23926":"Basic aromas are low on fruit. This has a cutting, citric feel that's centered around juicy acidity. Sour grapefruit and tangerine flavors end with lasting citric acidity.","23931":"Gritty berry and bacon aromas are forceful. Matching the nose, the palate feels raw and rubbery. Astringent tannins dry out plum and currant flavors. This Malbec-led blend is punchy, herbal and roasted tasting on the finish.","23933":"A mild chemical note on the nose gives way to stone fruits and some woodiness. This feels round, a touch oily and on the full side. Briny nectarine is the lead flavor, while this tastes salty on a flat-feeling finish.","23934":"Punchy prickly citrus aromas are clearly that of Sauvignon Blanc. Light in color and weight, this tastes of tangy citrus with a shot of black and green pepper. Lime is the key flavor noted on a clean but mild finish.","23937":"This has an oily gritty nose and a palate with lemony acidity. Flavors of lemon and green currant fall off and turn a touch bitter on the finish, something you could probably predict given the gritty start.","23956":"Mulchy, leafy aromas lead to a pinchy palate with salty, hard berry flavors that lack cushion. This is a rough wine with saltiness and bitterness on the finish.","23965":"This is a leathery, stalky type of Malbec with fierce acidity and a pinched mouthfeel. Try as you might to find richness and heft, this is going to come across acidic and narrow, with herbal flavors and a finish that tastes like tomato and sour plum. For Argentine Malbec at this price point, this needs help.","23973":"This is yet another plump, sweaty smelling Sauvignon Blanc from this producer. This vintage is fat in the mouth but kept alive by adequate young acidity. Salty, briny flavors of citrus, particularly grapefruit, end in similar briny fashion.","23975":"This is so heavy it's nearly a solid and not a liquid. Maximum ripeness is on display at all check points, especially the palate, which is syrupy, raisiny and viscous on the finish. This is as rich and ripe as it gets, like spineless Port. Tasted twice with inconsistencies; this review more greatly reflects the better bottle.","24091":"A clean and easy style of Chardonnay with peach and melon aromas followed by a melony palate with nectarine and a touch of sweetness. It flattens out and loses intensity on the finish, but overall it's totally drinkable and solid.","24093":"Big, bulky and granular, with high alcohol and saucy, raisiny aromas. The palate and flavors find a comfortable resting spot, and the wine's baked berry and brown sugar flavors are solid if a little forced and sweet. A rich wine that needs to be drunk soon.","24097":"Candied, tutti-frutti aromas give this a sweet, somewhat faux bouquet with little concentration. But the palate is chewy and grabby enough, with solid but modest raspberry and red plum flavors. Mellow on the finish, with a decent feel. Good but not distinguished. Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.","24103":"Generic berry aromas with a hint of tomato and bramble set this off as a different breed, which it is, considering it's 78% Tannat. The palate has biting tannings and toughness, while the flavors of raspberry and strawberry are snappy. Finishes strange, with pronounced butter and foxiness. Has its positives and negatives.","24116":"Clean and basic, with peach, buttercup and floral aromas. The palate is round, simple, fresh and not too acidic, with melony flavors and a soft, easygoing, monotone finish. Generic but perfectly adequate Torront\u00e9s; drink now.","24134":"Like most Monteviejo Malbecs, this is full and extracted, with an opaque purple tint. Ripe aromas of blackberry, prune and spice cake are generous. The palate is surprisingly alive in acidity and grabby in feel. Dark toasty black-fruit flavors are plenty oaky, while coffee, mocha and chocolate flavors share space on the tannic finish. Drink through 2020.","24233":"Round, melony and driven by aromas of pears and apples, this internationally styled wine should strike a chord among casual Chardonnay quaffers. It's kind of sweet, a little bit fat, and it finishes smooth. True to the blueprint in many ways; think California and this will complete the picture. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.","24240":"A cool quality runs through the dark-fruit bouquet, which has notes of leather and earth in reserve. The palate is forward and fruity, and it settles on the finish with a touch of plushness and a little chocolate flavor. Straightforward, and with some depth. This is a nice Argentine Tempranillo that happens to be organic.","24244":"Mildly roasted and leafy, with dry berry aromas. This is ripe and juicy on the palate, with berry, black cherry and mocha flavors. Finishes almost creamy, with honest structure and medium-range tannins. Drink now.","24325":"Fresh and not too oaky on the bouquet, with apple comprising the fruit element. Feels full and a bit rich, with plump, sweet flavors of apple touched up by spice. Turns stickier and more sweet on the finish, but overall this is a very solid Chard for the money.","24342":"Earthy and mulchy smelling on first take, with leather and solid berry and plum aromas. Feels bold, round and dedicated as it tastes a bit baked, with dark plum and cassis carrying the fruit component. Figgy, smooth and lasting on the finish.","24375":"Cherry and berry aromas are standard and good. Feels a bit edgy and clipped, with slightly herbal red plum flavors accented by a lot of oak and pepper. Turns real spicy and hot on the finish.","24415":"Cherry, plum, bacon and licorice are all good aromas that indicate that this value wine has quality backing it up. The palate is fresh and clean, with depth and ripe, slightly oaked flavors of cassis, blackberry and chocolate. Easy to like, with toasty touches throughout.","24510":"This driving blend of Malbec with Syrah and Cabernet hails from Argentina's most northern vineyards.Bruising black plum and cassis aromas have mossy, floral sidenotes. It's grapy but not monotone, so you get boysenberry then spice flavors, especially clove. This is toasty on the finish, which has drying tannins.","24832":"Dense on the nose, with a mix of black fruit aromas and mild herbs. The palate is properly acidic and elevated, with complex flavors of coconut, plum, berry, mocha, chocolate and spice. Quite oaky but the oak comes across well, i.e. friendly mocha and coffee. 64% Malbec with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Tannat.","24909":"Floral, reedy aromas of red berry fruits and plum lead to a ripe, saturated palate with earthy, stewed flavors of prune and blackberry. The prune continues on the finish, which brings saltiness and a chocolaty nuance.","24949":"This is floral and candied upfront, with a red licorice note. It feels full and fleshy, with hints of red berry and cassis, with not too much oak on the palate. Ripe, basic, clean and sweet as a whole.","25132":"Rooty, spicy aromas of cola and herbal plum are slightly smoky and leafy. This is fleshy and open on the palate, with spicy, herbal flavors of tomato, tea and black plum. A similar herbal, meaty quality lasts onto the finish.","25138":"Slightly stalky aromas of melon and papaya are solid and varietally correct. This Tupungato Chard feels solid, with a mild stony quality. The combination of apple and citrus flavors finishes leesy and a touch flat.","25141":"Floral tropical-fruit aromas start out strong but break up and turn a bit oily upon airing. Solid on the palate, this tastes of lychee, mango and white pineapple. Good acidity preserves the finish.","25165":"Berry and rubber band are the lead aromas. The wine has texture and lasting freshness despite being more than a year old already. It's medium in size and body, with red fruit and apple skin flavors. Solid, fruity and just lively enough.","25168":"Lemony and strange at first, with gamy notes, leather and incense. The palate feels chunky and medicinal, with herbal, sweet, jumbled flavors of candied blackberry. Finishes flat and quick, leaving medicinal sweetness.","25215":"Cool herbal aromas of blackberry and cola are minty. This feels narrow, with hard tannins that aren't ready to reconcile now. Herbal salty flavors of meaty berry fruits are warm, spicy and steadfast with herbal notes through the finish. Drink through 2020.","25236":"Yellow in color, with mildly briny aromas of citrus fruits and sauerkraut, this Pinot Noir-Chardonnay feels round, with a sense of richness to the palate. Salty peach flavors end with stone-fruit notes and a hint of popcorn.","25255":"Hot and fiery at first, but then it tames itself while revealing jammy blackberry and roasted plum aromas. Feels extracted and full, with a mix of baked berry, herb and peppery flavors that run deep and delicious. Spicy and chocolaty on the oaky finish, with smooth tannins, sweetness and oaky length. Drink now through 2014.","25303":"Compact, gritty, stalky aromas are hard and herbal. This feels narrow and short on body, while flavors of generic berry fruits are a bit green and low on richness and depth. Oaky vanilla notes drive the finish.","25409":"Big plum and berry aromas announce that this has fuel in the tank. It's well balanced in a normal way, with baked plum, red berry and toasty flavors. This is packed with a lot of raw flavor and power. From Rio Negro in Patagonia.","25523":"Round, melony and pleasant, with tropical\/floral aromas. Flavorwise, it's all about medium-intensity melon and lychee, and as Torront\u00e9s goes this one is likable and well made. It covers the tropical fruit bases and adds in some peppery dryness on the finish.","25562":"Varietally correct aromas of white flowers, lychee and tropical fruits feed into a plump, creamy palate that's losing some of the steam it probably had when it was bottled. Melon, banana and lychee flavors finish on the heavy, creamy side. Drink immediately.","25571":"Earthy, spicy, concentrated red-berry aromas give way to a full palate with spicy, oaky lead flavors and secondary red-fruit notes. Dry spice and a dusting of chocolate rise up on a simple finish.","25575":"Grassy, lightly weedy aromas set up a palate with sweet citrus and melony flavors. This is sticky and a touch mealy come finishing time, with a fleshy, unctuous feel and only modest structure and acidity.","25578":"Ginger, lemongrass and herbaceous aromas precede a zesty, citric palate with sharp acidity. This hints at sour lemon and grapefruit flavors while bringing in sweeter lime and melon notes. A cleansing, citric finish is tart to sour. 85% Torront\u00e9s and 15% Riesling.","25656":"Earthy black-fruit and spice aromas are clean and welcoming, while this is potent and full of life on the palate. Black cherry, coffee and chocolate flavors are intense and finish with a notable amount of minty menthol character. Drink through 2019.","25661":"This smells wild, with a jumpy cherry aroma. The palate is huge and tannic in the mouth, and it's blasting with minty oak, marshmallow and black fruit flavors.","25697":"Tropical in scent, almost to the point of air freshener, this also has an oily, bitter hint to the bouquet. It feels choppy and citric, with a nuttiness to the core of tangerine, lemon and melon flavors. Good but fading.","25709":"An oily popcorn aroma mixes with a tropical fruit note on this midlevel Torront\u00e9s. It feels round and chunky on the palate, with flavors of pineapple and citrus. The finish deals both sweet banana and lemon notes.","25743":"Sweet oak on the nose results in creamy, chocolaty aromas, along with herbal notes, plum and berry. Feels tight but expansive, with solid tannins, bright acids and solid flavors of herbs, berry fruit, cassis, toast and chocolate. Keeps it together on the finish.","25843":"Like all of Alta Vista's single-vineyard Malbecs, this is opaque in color and ripe on the nose. Aromas of balsamic-coated raisin, black cherry and chocolate scream ripe and rich. On the palate, this is saturated, with grabby tannins. Toasty blackened flavors of blackberry and pepper narrow down on a tight tannic finish. Drink through 2024.","25863":"While this is immensely oaky on the nose, that wood and char works because it comes with ripe cassis, blackberry and raisin scents. Chewy, ultraripe and tannic on the palate, this tastes of sweet black fruits, chocolaty oak and wood. An oaky reprise is front and center on a grabby stacked finish. Drink through 2023.","25893":"Exotic aromas of wild berries, cumin and other Middle Eastern spices are interesting and inviting. This feels thick and chewy, bordering on syrupy, with stewed plum and brown sugar flavors. It hits with some burn and heat on the bullish finish.","25959":"Floral aromas, berry scents, wet cement and saucy notes drive the nose on this viscous, almost sticky Malbec. Baked berry flavors don't show much follow through on the finish, which offers more minty oak than fruit.","25961":"This is a highly fragrant Torront\u00e9s with exotic tropical aromas of lychee and bath oil. Light and fresh in body, this tastes of pithy citrus and lychee before hollowing out. A lingering finish with good acidity is the close.","25964":"Rubbery, stalky berry aromas rate as earthy. In the mouth, this hammers away with cheek-grabbing tannins. Stewed plum, tomato and herbal flavors carry over onto a chunky finish. This is 50% Malbec, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and the rest Syrah and Petit Verdot.","26008":"With oak-driven aromas of mocha, coffee, cedar and berry fruits, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot is effusive on the nose. Concentrated and huge, but well balanced, it offers high-volume berry, herb, chocolate and spice flavors\u2014the lynchpins of excellent wines. Spicy, long and elegant on the finish, this is the real deal. Drink through 2021.","26160":"A year or two ago when Paul Hobbs began consulting for Toso things changed for the better. This is the rare Best Buy that can swim with the big fish and give them a run for the money. Pop the cork and enjoy lusty dark aromas of Turkish tobacco and berry compote. In the mouth, there's a riot of fruit flavors to ponder followed by a smooth, lusty finish.","26314":"Cherry, raspberry, herb and tomato aromas correctly announce a tightly clamped palate. Herbal plum and raspberry flavors are maintained on a tight, unbreakable finish. This is staunch and tight, with more than enough herbal character.","26580":"Cool, piercing aromas suggest wood grain and maple alongside blackberry and cassis scents. This massive wine is tannic, but meaty and friendly at its base. Savory, inky flavors of plum and floral-berry fruits finish with strong oak; fortunately this has the structure and fruit to handle it. Drink through 2024.","26818":"Grapy, jammy boysenberry and blueberry aromas are exotic, with integrated barrel and spice notes. This feels weighty but balanced; flavors of blueberry, currant and chocolate finish with plum-like juiciness and length. Drink through 2021.","26844":"Blackberry and prune aromas show herbal notes and a hint of dried leaf. Medium-full in size and friendly in feel, this has moderate acidity that lends freshness. Gritty, peppery black-fruit flavors finish with an echo of licorice and dark spice. Drink through 2021.","26862":"Aromas of earthy, raisiny berry fruits, graphite, coffee grinds and wood smoke set up a jammy, plump palate with wavering focus. Spicy prune, berry and cassis flavors are rooty, while coffee, mocha and oak flavors dominate the finish. Drink through 2019.","27104":"Ripe black-fruit aromas are loaded with fine oak and notes of licorice and sandalwood. A solid mile-deep palate is intense, layered and balanced. Creamy oak, aged cheese, black fruits and an exotic accent create an impressive combination of flavors, while this is muscular, warming and tastes dark and minty on the finish. Only 200 cases produced. Drink through 2022.","27129":"A little sweet on the nose, but also fairly scattered and unfocused. The feel is nice and the bubble bead is right on. But the flavors are centered around dull apple, and there seems to be a salinic element that makes everything taste a little salty.","27145":"If you're looking for a pedestrian but true sparkling wine for under $10, this Chenin Blanc-based bubbly from Argentina is solid, a touch yeasty and dry. It tastes much like a Loire Valley sparkler, with baked apple, apricot and peach pit flavors. On the negative side, it's fairly foamy across the tongue and doesn't have a top-grade mouthfeel.","27179":"Jammy muscled-up aromas of blackberry show hints of spice, especially red chili flake. This feels full, round and comfortable, with moderate tannic clamp. Herbal black-fruit flavors finish bold, with a touch of dry bitter oak.","27214":"An aggressive bouquet of raw wood, rubber, coconut, licorice and blackberry introduces a driving palate with powerful berry, plum and cassis flavors. This features bright acidity, plenty of weight and a lightly oaked finish with residual flavors of tomato, licorice and cassis.","27309":"A little bit hickory-dominated on the bouquet, but also giving balsamic notes, blackberry and chocolate mint. The palate is linear due to a streak of cutting acidity, while the palate is also snappy with wild raspberry and bright plum flavors and plenty of wood tannin. A toasty finish with espresso and chocolate is fine and long. Drink now through 2017.","27313":"Appealing from the start, with minerality, crustiness and tight dark berry aromas. The palate is saturated and layered, with flavors of blackberry, coffee and chocolate. Offers grip and structure due to fine tannins, and it's ready to drink now.","27412":"Granular, raisiny and heavy on the nose, with jammy blackberry aromas. The palate then hits with a thud; it's chunky and low in acidity, which yields a thick flavor set of prune and coffee. Better once it breathes, but it's still a bit too sticky and syrupy for our liking.","27413":"For Argentine PG it's attractive. The nose is clean but simple, while the palate is fresh and easy, with driving pineapple and lemon flavors being pushed along by good acidity. Juicy and wet on the finish, and overall it ranks as a nice, fruity wash.","27427":"Gritty aromas of saddle leather, horse hide and pickled berries filter into a choppy feeling palate with briny and herbal flavors. There's also notes of berries and salt. A chewy finish has weight, structure and saucy, pickled flavors of savory berry fruits.","27440":"This is called a \u201cwhite from Malbec\u201d because it spends little time on its skins during maceration. The color is translucent pink, and the nose is pure wood smoke and minerals due to six months of barrel fermentation and aging. As a result of this unusual methodology, wood resin, sawdust, vanilla and creaminess cover the nose, mouth and finish, while fruit characteristics are hard to locate.","27518":"Dry, fresh aromas of red fruits set up a tight, sinewy palate with little to no fat. Direct, hard-hitting flavors of cherry and berry fruits are what they are. Overall, this is a forward wine with low amounts of spice and complexity.","27727":"Mild and powdery smelling, with inviting tropical undertones. The palate mixes flesh with freshness, and the flavors of lychee, green melon and white pepper are straight from the textbook. Finishes mildly bitter, which is natural for Mendoza Torront\u00e9s.","27729":"Granular and punchy upfront, with heat and animal fur aromas on the nose. Settles with airing, revealing a heavy but solid palate with plenty of oak and candied red-fruit flavors. Falls off on the finish, with mint, resin and herbal notes.","27756":"Lean and angular on the nose, with crisp cherry and rhubarb aromas. Surprisingly elegant in the mouth, with citrus notes, zesty raspberry, clean cherry and a lightness of being. Nice in an unassuming way, with a touch of complexity.","27758":"Full, solid and dishing pretty aromas of blackberry, dark plum and mild spice. Sturdy in the mouth, with nice balance and above-average mouthfeel. Tastes ripe, lightly toasted and it finishes smooth if a bit short. Textbook value Malbec; easy to like.","27770":"Woody on the nose, with aromas of tree bark, pepper, cola and black fruit. The palate is tight but under control, with spiced black plum and herbal berry flavors. Toasty and healthy on the finish, but also slightly bitter tasting, with zesty lasting acidity.","27784":"The nose on this choppy Cabernet deals red-fruit, tomato and pepperoni-like aromas. The palate is full of life and tight acidity, while the flavor profile is gritty and includes baked plum and saltiness. A BBQ'd, oaky finish carries plenty of the wine's racy acidity, leaving mild tartness.","27793":"After nothing but busts in the past, this S\u00e9millon is in good shape but won't stay fresh for long. Aromas of hay and stalky fruits are a bit strained. In the mouth, it's got good feel and flavors of nectarine and grapefruit. Bitter almond skin flavors control the finish on this textured, warm wine.","27803":"For a basic Chardonnay, this fits the bill. Citrus and peach aromas are standard and clean. The palate is tight and juicy, with no overt oak feel. Flavors of melon and pear have light spice and vanilla accents, while the finish is crisp.","27808":"Minty green aromas blend with leathery red-fruit scents on what amounts to a gritty bouquet. The mouthfeel on this single-vineyard Malbec is rubbery, rugged and tannic, with a beam of tangy acidity keeping it moving. Flavors of rubber, salty berry and spice are sharp, and the finish is tannic.","27972":"Blueberry and other sweet berry aromas are flowery but not very staunch or dark. The palate has a high acidity level and a scouring feel to go with tart, driving cherry and red plum flavors. Scratchy, zesty and crisp on the finish, with tight tannins that draw down.","27985":"Generic red berry aromas show a stalky element as well. The palate is juicy and acidic, with a pointed quality that makes the feel a little hard. Flavors of standard red berry are sweet but undistinguished. Good but regular.","28035":"Although this San Juan SB offers almost nothing on the nose, it's fresh and popping with acidity on the palate. Flavors of briny citrus are entirely familiar, while this finishes with cleansing crispness.","28083":"This new Chardonnay from chalky soils smells of lanolin and waxy orange. On the palate, this shows some minerality but mostly it's bulky and citric. Briny stone-fruit flavors finish flat.","28093":"Selecci\u00f3n is proving itself to be a consistent modern Malbec (the last four vintages have rated 89 or 90 points). This rendition shows graphite, inky berry notes and savory spice aromas such as cumin and cardamom. It's rich and full bodied, with tobacco, coconut and baked plum and berry flavors. A smooth finish is neither tannic nor overpowering.","28207":"Ripe borderline raisiny aromas include earth, cedar and graphite scents. This is concentrated, grabby and fully extracted. Flavors of jammy black fruits blend with spicy saucy notes prior to a finish with flavors of tomato, herbs, salt and gamy meat. Firm acidity guarantees this will last at least another five years before falling off.","28256":"A zesty, lean-boned wine, but give it credit for offering classic pepper and raspberry aromas mixed with a touch of pickle and green. The palate is properly sized and balanced, with tart plum flavors that are satisfying enough. Not a deep or sophisticated wine, but it's clean and pretty good for Argentine Pinot.","28349":"Gritty aromas of saddle leather, horse hide and pickled berries filter into a choppy feeling palate with briny and herbal flavors. There's also notes of berries and salt. A chewy finish has weight, structure and saucy, pickled flavors of savory berry fruits.","28360":"This well-aged Cab Franc opens with raw, scratchy aromas that can best be described as abrasive and herbal. The palate brings a hard, acidic feel and high-toned, herbal flavors of cherry, plum and rhubarb. A lactic oak flavor meshes with green bean notes on the finish.","28404":"Trapiche may be on to something with this Atlantic Coast Pinot Noir. Earthy aromas suggest bacon, tire rubber and oak-infused berry and cherry. The mouthfeel is fresh but weighty. Flavors of roasted cherry and plum are earthy, while this inaugural Pinot from south of Buenos Aires tastes meaty and feels warm on the finish.","28405":"Dry grainy, full-force oak aromas are front and center, with spiced apple notes playing in the backdrop. This is scorchingly oaky, with about as much toasty new oak as any Chardonnay can handle. Flavors of burnt wood and resiny apple finish extremely woody.","28411":"This is a ripe Malbec with aromas of pipe tobacco, raisin and blackberry. The palate is rich and saturated, but a bit raisiny. Borderline overripe flavors of blackberry and cassis come with savory notes, while this is jammy, heavy and tastes of mint, spice and chocolate on the finish. Drink through 2021.","28448":"Blackberry and cassis aromas are ripe and floral like violets. The palate is more tannic than fully built. Berry and plum flavors show tea and light herbal notes, while flavors of coffee, thyme and plum share space on a bright finish.","28505":"Green and herbal, with a mix of jammy raspberry and weediness to the nose. The palate feels heavy and grabby, while the flavor profile holds onto the bouquet's herbal, tomatoey quality. Overly peppery and green throughout.","28508":"Smells a bit acrid, with aromas of peach pit and chemical. The palate is short on structure and offers punch-like sweetness in the mango\/papaya field of play. Very juicy but not tasting or smelling very defined.","28627":"Overdone aromas of candle wax, incense and air freshener show the musky side of the grape, while the palate is heavy with nectarine and citrus flavors. Finishes a little pithy and mealy, with a final wave of muskiness.","28628":"Starts out short and dry on the nose, with little fruit character. The palate is also on the hard and lean side, with tart strawberry and raspberry flavors. Short but mild on the finish; fades away fast.","28635":"Wayward and slightly weedy on the nose, with candied fruit notes that help it along. The palate is more acidic and rhubarby than ideal, although the tartness is offset by a creamy flavor of carob bean. Short and hot on the finish; acceptable but not well executed.","28643":"Mildly pickled red-fruit aromas fail to convey freshness or ripeness, and so it's no surprise that the core flavors are a bit herbal and briney. Decent mouthfeel helps it along, while the finish is short and borders on medicinal.","28655":"An oaky, complex wine based on Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, The Blend shows floral notes unmatched by almost all other Mendoza\/Tupungato wines. Violets and rose petals interact with earthy fruit on both the nose and palate. And unlike the masses, this wine doesn't make its point by pounding away with overextracted fruit. A different breed but well worth it. Only 40 cases made.","28656":"Calling this big-boned brew potent may be understating things. This is brawny Tupungato Malbec in full armor. Early oak-driven aromas of hard cheese and char support muscular black fruit scents, while the palate is ripe and sweet as it offers blackberry and cassis flavors. Comfortable on the palate and well balanced overall.","28785":"This warm-weather Viognier is fleshy and chunky on the bouquet, with generic white-fruit aromas that suggest gardenias. A plump palate is low on acid and heavy in weight; flavors of melon and green herbs finish soft and could turn flabby in a short time.","28811":"Nicely integrated plum, cassis, cinnamon and mineral aromas come across with purpose. This feels healthy, lively and firm. Flavors of baked berry fruits, spice, pepper and a sauvage wildness finish steady and with warmth in layers. Drink through 2022.","28904":"Cherry, tea, spice and citrus peel aromas lead to a balanced palate. This tastes of citrus, raspberry, spiced plum and lightly buttered oak. A creamy sense carries over to the finish, but mostly this is lively and solid.","28909":"Minty oaky aromas include a strong whiff of clove and white gumdrop. A widegrabby chewy palate is a bit hot, while flavors of carob, mint and clove outweigh dark-fruit notes prior to a thick toasty heavily oaked finish.","28914":"Dry woody herbal berry aromas are leafy and a bit murky. This Cab Franc is fiercely tannic and drying, while oaky flavors of wood spice dominate generic berry fruit. Flavors of mint and pepper lead a rough and tannic finish.","29006":"Standard for the variety, orange and honeyed aromas rest in front of a wide but tangy feeling palate with orange, nectarine and passion fruit controlling the flavor profile. On the finish, there's just enough acidic cut and weight for things to end nicely.","29007":"This Malbec is black as night, with shoe polish, charred oak and black-fruit aromas. The palate is borderline syrupy, with ripe, heavily charred flavors of blackened berry, vanilla and mint. On the finish, it's weighty and peppery tasting, with heat.","29010":"For a lighter-bodied Cabernet, this is good for its fresh, clean outlook and mild oak. Cherry and berry aromas set the stage for a juicy wine with mild cherry and raspberry flavors that come before a spunky, quick finish.","29119":"Standard-issue berry and plum aromas turn warm and leathery with airing. The palate on this Malbec-Bonarda-Syrah blend is juicy, but it comes with a choppy feel. Tastes brambly and wild, with red berry fruit and a briary, leathery finish.","29120":"Chunky and oily on the nose, with basic white fruit aromas of peach and apple. The palate is full and balanced, with nectarine, pineapple and lychee flavors. Pithy and citrusy on the finish. Ripe and good in a regular way.","29174":"Initially, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat smells murky, leathery and nutty, but with airing it settles and cleans up. Chunky and close to being oversaturated, this full-bodied red tastes of loamy berry and raisin, while the finish is weighty.","29203":"This is gorgeous on the bouquet, with earth, flower blossom, licorice and sandalwood aromas. It feels lush and layered, with ripe, happy flavors of sultry black fruit and cassis. Fruity, long and delicious on the finish, this is a very easy Malbec to dig into now and until 2015.","29390":"A mix of floral, tropical and citrus aromas is more than fine. A snappy citric palate is racy and high in cleansing acidity. Citrus flavors are plain and simple, while this is entirely clean and fresh on the finish.","29406":"Aromas of mango and scented potpourri set up a dry solid palate. This blend of Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay is not something you see a lot of. Flavors of white pepper and nectarine finish juicy, with notes of peach pit and orange peel.","29500":"Mild plum and berry aromas are smell a bit like aromatized soap. With cherry, raspberry and brown sugar flavors, this is a friendly wine without much Pinot character.","29558":"Narrow berry aromas are angular and punchy. This feels high in acidity, with hard tannins. That sharp acidity makes for tart unyielding black plum flavors.","29559":"A mix of blueberry, plum and animal aromas leads to a wiry, clipped palate fueled by tartaric acid. Lightly salted plum flavors are slightly jammy, while a blueberry note is brought back on the finish.","29572":"Aromas of roasted but slightly weedy berry fruits, road tar and latex precede a raw shallow pulling palate. This Malbec tastes of salty and savory black plums, tomatoes and herbs. On the finish, this delivers mostly spaghetti-sauce flavors.","29581":"Horsey plum and pie cherry aromas include a whiff of latex gloves and Band-Aid. This feels rather raw and acidic, with bite. Salty sharp red-fruit flavors finish herbal, with tartaric shear.","29597":"Crimson in color but also translucent, with a candied, slightly green nose. Overall this is a simple quaffer with no excess weight and reasonably good flavors of berry and plum. Bland on the finish, but for $4 who's caring about finish?","29600":"Smells sweet and artificial, with chemical notes and overwrought vanilla. Juicy in the mouth, with flesh and freshness. But the flavors are oaky, so much so that the wine's citrus and apple quality is masked. Finishes with grapefruit and bitterness. Weird and all over the map.","29626":"Cherry and plum aromas are solid but slightly herbal. A dense, compact palate is a bit heavy as cassis, spicy berry and oak flavors spread out. Medicinal herbal notes are notable on a lush, powerful finish with minty oak.","29632":"Minty, roasted berry aromas open this well-built Cabernet that's packed with plum, raspberry and wood-spice flavors. There's nothing complicated about this lively, oaky wine that runs long on the finish.","29655":"Blueberry, plum and cardamom aromas include a whiff of wood smoke. A balanced palate has energy along with brambly berry and chocolate flavors. A chewy, solid finish is good but less lively than the palate.","29702":"Every year this wine seems to get better. This vintage deals notes of lemon pie, melon and lychee on the bouquet, which is followed by a palate that's oily yet racy. Flavors of lychee and pineapple are true to Torront\u00e9s, while green herb and lime notes stir things up.","29762":"A bouquet with tomato leaf, spice, dust and saucy berry aromas sets the stage for a basic feeling palate. Saucy red plum flavors are offset by sweet, oaky molasses notes, while a touch of nutmeg and oak character rise up late.","29776":"Gritty aromas of asphalt, herbs, tomato and plum make for a tough opening. This is syrupy and grabby on the palate, with creamy berry and cooked brown-sugar flavors. A sinewy finish tastes medicinal and a touch weedy.","29785":"Yeasty aromas indicate that early oxidation is setting in on this blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc. A lean palate with sizzling malic acid but little body deals bready flavors of generic white fruits. Oxidized flavor notes return on the finish.","29793":"Lightly vegetal aromas of asparagus and canned beans are intermixed with generic citrus scents. This wine is more acid than anything, with angularity to the palate. Salty, tart, citric flavors finish racy and with a lingering note of sour orange.","29813":"Stewy, earthy berry aromas are mulchy and lack freshness. This has a cooked and rubbery mouthfeel to go with stalky, savory berry and plum flavors. A green, leathery character shows on the finish.","29816":"With its reliance on old-vines vineyards, Renacer often comes out with great wines. This is one of them. Smoky, leathery berry aromas are inviting, while the mouthfeel is silky and plush. Oaky flavors of chocolate, smoked meat and vanilla accent ripe berry flavors, then clove and baking spices pour onto the finish.","29820":"Jammy, ripe and loaded with inky, sweet black-fruit aromas, the bouquet on this modern Cab Franc draws you in. Once there, look for a big but balanced palate with blackberry, roasted notes, loam and chocolate flavors. The satisfying finish is pure and long, with toasty blackness.","29970":"Melon and citrus aromas are clean and easy, not pungent. This feels good, with limited but solid white-grapefruit and orange flavors. A dry juicy finish tastes mildly bitter but isn't too severe.","29985":"Foxy aromas of wet dog and plum and berry feed into a raw tannic palate. This tastes herbal, with a green note added to its core red-fruit flavors. A choppy, hard-tannin finish is rugged and abrasive.","30014":"Intensely dark in color, this syrupy rich, extracted Malbec pushes the envelope of max ripeness via heady balsamic aromas of leather, blackberry and cassis. The palate couldn't be much riper, while heavy oak means flavors of chocolate, vanilla and wood grain are as prominent as the wine's massive berry fruit components. Drink through 2020.","30087":"Aromas of tree bark, baked sugar beet, herbs and licorice blend with earthy black-fruit scents on this ripe, jammy, generous Cabernet. Baked blackberry, licorice, rooty spice and cassis flavors finish with herbal notes, a spicy black peppercorn flavor, a licorice hint and smooth tannins.","30088":"This smells mildly reduced and candied at first, with notes of blackberry, horse hide and licorice. Firm, chewy and lush on the palate, this full-force Malbec delivers ripe blackberry, boysenberry, spice and rooty licorice flavors prior to a spicy, dark finish that's bolstered by firm acidity. Drink through 2019.","30201":"Compact, minerally aromas include notes of leather and licorice. Round and generous across the palate, this ripe, rooty tasting Malbec features flavors of blackberry and chocolate in front of a mildly raisiny finish. Drink this warm-vintage Malbec through 2019.","30206":"Concentrated and woody smelling, this ripe Cabernet is cut from the modern mold, meaning it's weighty and fully oaked. As for mouthfeel, expect severe tannins but also cuddly depth. Flavors of roasted, earthy berry fruits and cassis finish with oaky flavors of cocoa and mocha as well as herbal notes. Drink this integrated Cab through 2021.","30213":"Concentrated blackberry and prune aromas are wrapped in a blanket of chocolaty oak. Side-to-side jamminess and beefy tannins make for a full-force mouthfeel, while minty blackberry flavors end plush but with focus. Herbal notes of rosemary, thyme and mint add complexity. Drink through 2024.","30214":"Cheesy oak is the greeting on the nose of this older Malbec from a notoriously tough vintage. After that, earthy, stewed blackberry and meaty aromas come up. This is saturated and a touch stewy, with baked black-fruit flavors as well as gamy animal notes. A dense finish tastes soupy and savory. Drink through 2018.","30218":"Trisagio is a Malbec-led blend with Cab Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. It's a dense wine offering the full allotment of berry, earth and meaty aromas. Plump and layered across the palate, this tastes of chocolaty oak, baking spices, herbs, cassis and a pinch of salt. A long, pure finish is a nice topping; drink through 2021.","30224":"Herbal notes of pine and eucalyptus rest on top of a bedding of spiced cherry and cassis aromas. This Malbec blend is firm and structured, with no weaknesses around the edges or in the middle. Ripe blackberry, spice, mocha and molasses flavors finish toasty but alive. Drink through 2021.","30243":"Argentine Nebbiolo is a rarity, and for one to be this good is a blessing. Leather, dark berry, earth and citrus aromas are mellow and subdued, but the palate is full and forward, with baked berry, molasses and espresso flavors. This is tannic and chocolaty on the finish, with lasting sweetness.","30462":"Jammy aromas of berry fruits and cardamom struggle to hold up. A smacking acidic palate lacks body and depth, while this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec tastes of plum and cranberry in front of a jammy tasting finish that feels raw.","30484":"Aromas of dried white flowers and citrus fruits are mild. This feels round pulpy and good. Flavors of melon and papaya aren't complex, but they satisfy. On the finish, this everyday Chardonnay is round in feel and tastes a touch salty.","30524":"Hard-packed, concentrated black-fruit aromas are a signal of this rugged Malbec's character. It's blasting with toasty blackberry and pepper flavors, which are backed by spice, heat and a general sense of full but proper ripeness and high quality. Drink through 2019.","30584":"Rooty, spicy aromas of black plum are more complex than those of your average Malbec. In the mouth, this shows a heavy, almost reduced mouthfeel that could use more spring. Dark, heavily toasted baked-plum flavors finish peppery and brooding, but without much texture or presence. Drink soon.","30596":"Leathery aromas blend well with concentrated black-fruit scents. In the mouth, this value-priced Malbec offers juicy purity and plenty of spunk. Flavors of black fruits, licorice and chocolate maintain a sense of freshness, while the finish offers residual blackberry and cassis flavors.","30680":"Earthy aromas suggest red cabbage and olive more than bright, ripe berry. The palate is chunky and clampy, with jammy, overly broad black fruit flavors that finish on the stewed and herbal side. Concentrated, massive and clumsy.","30686":"Opens with heat and brambly, scratchy aromas of black cherry. The palate is round if a bit sticky, with sweet, candied berry flavors. Round, sticky and sweet as well on the finish, with vanilla notes.","30747":"Baked, earthy aromas of raisin, fruitcake, ink and oak require plenty of air to show their best. A jammy, creamy, oaky palate is home to resiny flavors of vanilla, spice and berry fruits. The finish is woody, resiny and pasty, with ripe yet generic flavors in reserve.","30769":"The dark and penetrating aromas of violets, shoe polish, blackberry and road tar are solid. This feels a bit tough on the palate, with narrow tannins and flavors of rubber and black plum.","30790":"A ripe, raisiny wine\u2014it starts out with aromas of raisin, milk chocolate and candied berry. The palate is saturated, with prune and baked-plum flavors and a chunky finish. Drink now.","30791":"Dark and concentrated, this has jammy, raisiny aromas that are marked with a strong current of green. It feels full but a touch flat, with sweet berry flavors and a core of mint. The finish ends abruptly.","30850":"Fresh aromas of white gumdrop, quince and peach precede a peachy, citrusy palate. Dry citrus flavors persist on a clean finish. This is a fresh Chardonnay where less is more.","30851":"This cloudy, unfiltered Sauvignon Blanc charts new territory for Argentina. Ripe flavors of peach, pear and melon turn more bitter on the finish, which isn't long due to modest acidity.","30852":"Familiar Cab Franc aromas of dry spice, green herbs, fennel and pepperoni feed into a narrow palate that's high in acidity and drawing. Spiky tomato, plum, herb and pepper flavors finish dry and pulling, with a saucy aftertaste.","30853":"Initial aromas of desert herbs and blackberries lose steam with airing. A flush palate delivers candied cherry and chocolate flavors that carry over to the solid finish.","30854":"A mix of spice, oak, tomato, plum and rubbery aromas announce a palate that blends plump ripeness with pulling tannins. Dry, spicy plum and berry flavors are steady on the finish.","30868":"Floral aromas of gardenia and honeysuckle include lychee and a hint of green pepper. The palate on this textbook Torront\u00e9s is oily but fresh. Flavors of lychee and melon finish with light notes of salt and bitterness.","30871":"Peach and cantaloupe aromas are friendly and easy. A creamy palate with modest acidity offers slightly sweet flavors of dulce de leche and melon. A modest finish with spice and sugary notes closes this out.","30873":"Honeydew and nectarine aromas are fresh and representative of good Torront\u00e9s. This wine is round, oily and citric in feel, while lychee and green-melon flavors hold through the finish.","30910":"The nose is minty, herbal and strangely exotic, while the palate falls flat in delivering strongly herbal, tomato-based flavors.","30912":"This is cloudy to the eye, with a mix of vinegar, briny plum and milk chocolate on the nose. The mouthfeel is blowsy, while the flavors are briny and pickled.","30917":"Juniper and onion aromas are not inviting, and there's little fruit to back them up. The mouthfeel is oily, while flavors of briny citrus lead to a pickled-tasting finish. Tasted twice, with consistent results.","30919":"Overall this is a weak wine with resiny aromas of varnish followed by woody flavors of banana and vanilla. The finish is more or less the same, only less potent.","30925":"The nose deals a mix of exotic aromas along with offputting sweat, compost and funky cheese. The palate is pasty feeling and tannic, with lactic flavors of oak, licorice and medicinal berry. On the finish, clove and spice notes dominate.","30926":"Tropical fruit aromas are the lead-in, but upon airing the wine's pineapple and mango scents turn austere and prickly. The mouthfeel here is astringent and acidic, and the flavors are briny, even pickled.","30954":"This starts out tarry, but airing reveals aromas of tobacco, asphalt and oaky berry fruits. The mouthfeel is flush and extracted, but not overly heavy. Flavors of black fruits are more generic than specific, while the finish is tannic, with lively acidity. The blend is Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Bonarda.","30963":"Minerally, earthy aromas of plum and blackberry are oaky and attractive. This is round and well balanced, with cassis, blackberry, spice and herbal flavors settling on a spicy finish led by cardamom and clove notes as well as a smooth feel. Drink through 2017.","30969":"Spiced cherry, brandied plum and overt but high-quality buttery oak aromas open this red-fruit-driven Malbec from the heart of the Uco Valley in Mendoza. Flavors of toasted, creamy oak rest easily on top of kirsch and red plum flavors, while chocolaty, toasty, spicy flavors direct the finish. Drink this well-oaked, expressive heavyweight now through 2020.","30986":"Opens with tire rubber, char and minty, smoky black fruit. Feels mostly fresh and bold, with blackberry, blueberry and coffee flavors. Just dense, sweet and spicy enough, with espresso bitterness to the finish. Composed and competent value red wine.","31006":"More syrupy and chunky than ideal, but still a good wine with grilled meat, root beer and berry extract on the bouquet. The body seems a little baked and heavy, with molasses and raisin flavors mixing with blackberry. Finishes with melted brown sugar and soft tannins. A full, deep wine that shows a few signs of being overripe.","31048":"This is dark, oaky and minty on the nose, with inky aromas and scents of fresh-cut wood. A saturated, tight-feeling palate has oak as the pack leader, while mint and berry aromas float about. A jammy, woody, creamy finish is bullish but slightly hot.","31094":"Dig into this if you like superripe, rich Malbec. This is loaded with graphite, smoky oak, blackberry and baking spice aromas. Expect maximum ripeness across the palate, meaning bearish flavors of berry fruits, wood and toast. There's not a lot of distance or complexity to the finish, but getting that far is half the fun.","31315":"Dry, mossy berry aromas carry punch, while this well-built Malbec feels concentrated but not heavy. Peppery, blackened berry flavors spill over with a black-coffee note on a slightly hot finish. Drink through 2020.","31323":"Those familiar with Altocedro's Malbecs know that oak will be a key player. For this 200-case, small-batch wine, the nose offers a blast of barrel power that initially smells like a sawmill. The palate is bold and full, with flavors of buttery oak, vanilla and salty black fruits. There's grip to the finish, which, not surprisingly, tastes woody, dark and minty. Drink through 2022.","31336":"An elegant, floral Pinot Noir from Patagonia's top producer of PN. Barda is warm, creamy and intense. An emphasis on balanced raspberry and cherry flavors mixed with rose hip and freshness gives it an Old World personality. A very drinkable and honest style of red wine. Good now into 2011.","31386":"Funky at first and simply not as smooth, pure and clean as Catena's Nicasia and Adrianna Malbecs, which are the components of this wine. Argentino in 2007 is deep and dark like always, with coconut and cassis aromas preceding a sweet, ultrarich palate that's teetering on candied. Quite oaky and chocolaty as well, with brown sugar and depth to the finish. Drink now through 2014.","31406":"Big, lush and tightly structured, with cola and mocha aromas along with serious black fruit power and brightness. A pure and delicious Malbec-Cabernet wine with the full allotment of berry character, cola accents, dark spice and clarity. Drink now through 2014.","31516":"Potent but integrated oak and blackberry aromas come with a note of licorice. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc is blocky and almost collapses under its own weight. Herbal, spicy flavors of fresh mushroom, roasted plum and tomato are typical of Salta. It finishes full, saturated and a bit chunky. Drink through 2020.","31577":"Dark, gummy and full of heavily applied green oak, this wine has a candied, murky, resiny persona. And that's too bad, because it has potential; yet the tannins, wood resin, mesquite and beefy black fruit are all too dominant and thus it never settles or shows much harmony.","31612":"Leathery, smoky dark-berry aromas take on a burnt, stalky character as this airs out. Tight and linear in feel, this avoids being fat and overweight as it delivers roasted, blackened plum, black cherry and herbal flavors. The finish tastes a bit stalky and salty, with a demanding oak character taking over. Drink through 2020.","31615":"This opens with warm, earthy, horsey aromas that become cleaner with airing. A muscular palate with hard tannins and evident tartaric acidity creates edgy flavors that are matched by vanilla and darker-fruit notes of raspberry and plum. This is hard now, a bit disjointed and short in spots. Drink from 2016 through 2026 for best results.","31636":"Concentrated boysenberry, licorice and asphalt scents carry mild green accents of alfalfa and mint. This feels ripe and lush but not too heavy. Flavors of baked blackberry, licorice and loamy earth finish warm and cushioned, with notes of anise and pepper accompanied by some heat and burn. Drink through 2020.","31669":"This wine leads with big, rubbery, almost stewy aromas. In the mouth, this rich Malbec feels reduced and jammy, with heavy tannins. Flavors of blueberry and blackberry are infused with herbal notes, while the finish offers flavors of licorice and chocolate.","31685":"Stalky, leathery aromas suggest cooked fruit rater than freshness. This is normal in feel, while the flavor profile settles on rubbery, roasted, stalky berry fruits. Mild bitterness combines with earthiness on the finish.","31822":"Earthy, leathery, stewed aromas are more savory than fruity. The palate on this Malbec-led blend is full, flush and resiny. Savory blueberry, Middle Eastern spice notes and oaky flavors reside in front of a roasted finish with grab and grip.","31825":"Floral berry and plum aromas are direct and pure, emphasizing fruit over oak. A punchy palate follows the nose, while bright plum and berry flavors complete the package. This captures the essence of Malbec while not going overboard.","31890":"Woody aromas of tree bark, forest floor and earthy, minty berry fruits lead to a full and stocky feeling palate with wiry, herbal, oak-heavy flavors of plum and mint. On the finish, this is tannic, with strong spice notes and a hint of green.","31949":"Juicy and jumpy on the nose, but not sour. The palate of this dark, almost red Malbec ros\u00e9 is sweet and candied but also zesty due to pretty lively acids. It's not a stellar wine but it is full of berries and spunk.","31968":"This black wine, despite being almost seven years old, remains rich and balanced on the nose, where ripe aromas of raisin and earth offer a slight herbal, minty edge. The mouthfeel is 100% thick and jammy, while flavors of prune, baked blackberry and chocolate lead to a chewy finish. This blend of Malbec, Merlot and Tannat is a knife-and-fork wine to drink now.","32055":"This mighty Malbec opens with toasty oak, a pinch of sawdust and perfumed black fruit, vanilla and spice notes. The palate is lofty and rich, with beautiful berry and plum flavors. A smooth, sexy wine from the Uco Valley that shows that vineyard sourcing absolutely matters. Best wine from Alta Vista to date.","32163":"What herbal berry aromas this wine has evaporate fast, replaced by oaky clove and other spice notes. Iron tight and tannic, the wine draws on the cheeks. Spiced-up plum flavors set up a rugged finish with hard tannins and spicy berry residuals. Serve with beef or BBQ; it needs it.","32172":"Dark but reduced aromas of tire and blackberry set up a muscular palate with pinching tannins. Roasted, oaky flavors of spicy berry, clove and cocoa finish with a final woody note and choppy toughness.","32445":"On first take, this smells a bit chunky and like stewed plum. The palate is firm and tannic, with roasted plum and berry flavors that are more savory than fruity. On the finish, a spicy beef-jerky flavor vies for attention with raw tannins. Drink through 2020.","32470":"This shows patented bold blackberry aromas of Cabernet but also herbal, spicy, leafy notes as well. A crisp but thorough palate features pointy acidity, while herbal flavors of cassis, plum, spice, pepper and chocolate finish crisp and a bit sharp. Drink through 2022.","32472":"Stony, minerally aromas show a pinch of toast on top of white peach and apple cider scents. On the palate, this stays on the straight and narrow, with high acidity. Clementine and tangerine flavors finish as stony as the name implies; drink this shellfish-friendly, unique Argentinean Chardonnay through 2022.","32489":"Plum and blackberry aromas are fresh, while the palate on this fruity red is round and chewy. Blackberry and mild herbal notes make for a nice, familiar flavor profile, while the finish is solid and holds form.","32705":"Dark yet a touch murky on the bouquet, with weight and black-fruit aromas. The palate is plump but healthy, with peppery flavors accenting core blackberry and chocolate. Chunky and proper, if a tad bit bitter on the finish. Gets better as it airs out.","32715":"Ripe, fruity and jammy on the nose, with smokiness and earth to go with standard berry aromas. The palate leans towards full and jammy, with sweet berry and mild spice flavors. Chunky and full-bodied, but for the most part it gets things right.","32720":"Sweet black plum, licorice and anise aromas are soft yet nice. The palate, however, is more clacky, with jammy, reduced flavors of syrupy berry and sappy tannins. Jammy and saturated on the finish as well; tons of berry and size, but not perfectly balanced.","32730":"White fruit aromas are as expected and clean, with no faux oak, weight or interference. The palate is round but nicely acidic, with cutting texture and sweet, lightly creamy flavors of sweet peach, apple and butter. Turns slightly oaky late, with butterscotch and spice.","32733":"Black and charred at first, with licorice, asphalt and a touch of bacon on the bouquet. The palate is soft, soupy and round, with ripe, saturated berry and fig flavors. Finishes spicy and full, with chewy tannins and ample extract.","32798":"Gritty aromas of severely baked berry fruits are tough to plow through. In the mouth, this Malbec is jammy, chunky and a touch flat. Flavors of stewed berries and prune finish thick and taste cooked. Ready to drink now.","32814":"Tropical fruit and vanilla-cookie aromas come with a note of nectarine. This feels juicy, racy and citric, with flavors of tangerine and nectarine. Despite having tangy acidity, the wine turns heavy on the finish.","32818":"Ocean water and green banana are the lead aromas on this mostly neutral white. A light body with modest structure houses lime and tangerine flavors. The finish is juicy in feel but turns bitter as it rolls out.","32875":"Rooty, stalky, earthy aromas are spread wide and thin. This Cab has a gritty feel and hard tannins. Stalky flavors of coffee grinds are herbal and tough, while heat, sauciness and tomato-leaf flavors suggest cool-climate origins. Overall this is racy and cool in style; drink now.","32893":"Malbec and Bonarda are the lead grapes in this four-variety blend that shows improvement from the 2004, which was tough. Loads of ripe, dark fruit lead the way, with chewy, dense berry flavors coming next. It's bolstered by warm, oaky hints that settle on mocha and spice, so it fits the familiar style of what is good Mendoza wine.","32904":"For several vintages running Broquel has nudged the border between very good and excellent, but as in years past the '06 is a touch tangy and racy, with black cherry, plum and berry flavors. It's bold, zippy and quite high-toned, but still it's very competent and held together.","33048":"Pushy, smoky, forceful aromas of roasted blackberry and campfire set up a sticky feeling, slightly gummy palate that's full of berry, plum and rubbery flavors. On the finish, this flattens out and becomes heavier.","33051":"Although Argentina is hardly Pinot Grigio country, this is a tropical-style quaffer with good balance and enough acidity to avoid coming across heavy. Creamy aromas of melon and lychee set up flavors of nectarine and tangerine. A lasting but modest finish is fair and appropriate.","33066":"Nicely aromatic, with all that's good about affordable Malbec from Argentina: bold fruit, depth and some richness. The palate is plump and stocked with tasty blackberry, plum and raisin flavors, while the finish is sturdy and subtle. A good wine that should not offend anyone.","33067":"Shows pretty good concentration and depth on the nose, where it only slightly hints at the herbal character that comes later. The palate is a touch astringent, with cola, blackberry and herbal flavors. Persistent on the finish, but also herbal and not overly complex.","33148":"Light and mostly neutral smelling, with a hint of pear and apple. The palate is zesty, lean and well cut, however the flavors are more pithy and bitter, with orange and nectarine notes. Finishes hot and peppery.","33153":"Stalky aromas suggest hay and green herbs, with raspberry in the backdrop. It's hot and short in terms of mouthfeel, with herbal flavors leading the way and berry fruit running behind. Dry red fruit and herbal notes dominate the finish.","33162":"More briary and green than Torino's regular Don David Cab, with aromas of vinegar, lettuce, tomato and green pepper. Tannic, tight and juicy in the mouth, with green-leaning red currant and plum flavors. Tannic and grating on the finish.","33166":"A bit stalky to begin with; there's tobacco, herbs and generic berry aromas that turn raisiny upon airing. The palate is definitely on the raisiny side, and thus it's sweet, a bit flat and ultimately tastes and feels slightly overripe.","33170":"A disjointed, out-of-the-box Malbec that starts out peanutty and earthy on the nose. Things round out aromatically, but in the mouth it's angular and edgy, with stunted blackberry flavors offset by tartness. Has its positives but overall it doesn't fully click.","33263":"Savory, spicy, minty aromas are rustic and rooty. This feels big and broad, with a fair amount of body weight. Flavors of savory berry and leather filter into a creamy, full finish with a residual saline flavor.","33264":"Plum and wild berry aromas come with graphite and minty oak scents. This feels big, pushy and juicy, while the flavor profile is oak-dominated, with mint and resin outmuscling raspberry. The finish is barrel-driven via raw, woody flavors and a resiny feel.","33268":"Minerally dark-berry aromas come with a touch of spice. In the mouth, this is lively with a bolt of acidity behind the mouthfeel. Black cherry and berry are the flavors, while a hint of cocoa arises on a short yet fresh finish.","33271":"Oak is the main characteristic in this Malbec. Spicy aromas of clove and mint steer otherwise generic berry scents toward a thick palate with pointed acidity. This is short on complexity and the fruit is mildly sour, while mint, oak and baked notes define the finish.","33274":"Leather and earthy notes circle around core berry scents. This is medium bodied, with expansive but nonspecific berry and plum flavors. A wide, chunky finish is good but doesn't go beyond the basics.","33281":"A narrow bouquet offers mostly citrus peel. The palate is fairly plump in feel, with pithy, slightly bitter flavors of peach and tropical fruits. Mild bitterness on the finish keeps a lid on overall quality.","33282":"Sweet berry, wet cement, plastic and creamy oak aromas lead to a palate with plenty of grip. Flavors of oaky, roasted berry and vanilla finish sweet but also peppery and chocolaty, and with some heat.","33375":"Like many of this winery's bottlings, this is heavy and raisiny. However, amid all the thickness and extract there are lusty, robust roasted black fruit flavors and candied darkness. Baked on the finish, which feels hollow and doesn't last long.","33420":"Baked, earthy, reedy aromas yield to a narrow, tannic, awkward body. Sweet, green flavors are candied and flat. Time has passed this by.","33421":"Light prune aromas signify a wine on the cusp. Astringent and rubbery in the mouth, this is raw in feel and tastes raisiny and like briary raspberry.","33765":"Funky, off-base floral aromas and a sweet, cotton candy flavor profile. Feels flat and sugary to the end, with a nip of bitter almond.","33843":"Ripe but subtle aromas of aged balsamic vinegar, blackberry, baked plum and vanilla are alluring and feed into a flush layered palate. Spicy black plum and berry flavors are just rustic and toasty enough, while this blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with Cab Franc and Merlot tastes peppery, deep, a touch hot and on the money. Drink from 2018\u20132026.","33990":"This is a jammy, dense and pure Cabernet, with meat and berry aromas that mix in touches of graphite and chocolate. It feels a little hard and acidic despite its size, while the flavor profile is of mossy berry fruit and chocolate. Tight and nervy, this offers lots of acidic push on the finish.","34074":"This is a clean, non-oily Torront\u00e9s with tropical-fruit aromas. A balanced palate propels lychee, citrus and melon flavors toward a slightly chunky palate. This aromatic wine is in the heart of its quality window; drink immediately.","34075":"This opens hot and heavy, with pounding berry aromas and a touch of animal fur. The palate is full and compact, with jammy, syrupy berry and woodspice flavors. A long finish tastes of licorice and oak.","34085":"This oaky number offers enough meaty fruit to keep itself on an even keel. Gritty berry and sawdust aromas lead to a full-bodied, resiny palate. Woody, drying flavors rest heavily atop a core of medicinal, herbal berry fruit. It's ripe and resiny on the finish, which is consistent with what came beforehand.","34087":"Crisp cherry tomato and plum aromas turn more dark and grapy with airing. Jammy yet fresh and easy on the palate, this quaffable Malbec delivers simple berry flavors along with an exotic note or two. A short finish falls off fast.","34188":"Tough cherry and plum aromas lead it off, followed by simple, semitart raspberry flavors. There's not much depth or complexity; the palate bounces along inoffensively, and the finish is quick and light. Clean and basic wine.","34194":"Sweetly fragrant, with hints of pear and melon. The palate is wet, lean and acidic, which helps push the lychee and melon flavors. A clean, light, mild refresher with sharper-than-expected acids. Nothing more than that.","34204":"Kind of hard, pasty and candied on the nose, with a thick and chunky palate feel along with sweet, sugary, generic red fruit flavors. Hailing from Patagonia, this is a basic, creamy Cabernet with body and size but not too much character.","34205":"An unusual specimen, especially on the nose, where spicecake, floral and incense aromas are atypical. The palate is kind of sharp and immature, with grapey, blueberry flavors and coconut on the finish. A different breed of Malbec, but not what we'd call a slam-bang success.","34272":"For Argentina, this is as varietally correct as you're going to find for Sauvignon Blanc. The bouquet is loaded with pungent nectarine, citrus and peach pit aromas. Those are backed by a citrusy, angular, spritzy palate with lime and orange flavors. Tang is the operative word as the wine fades out with tangerine and grapefruit flavors.","34445":"A home run in middle-tier Malbec. Excellent power and balance are on display. It's firm, minerally and tight, but with generous berry and cassis aromas and flavors along with ample coffee, spice and mocha qualities. Impressive, especially given the price tag; drink now through 2014.","34452":"Pure on the nose, with plenty of pop. Aromas of dark black cherry are tight and smoky, with minerality. Flavors of cola and wild-berry fruits are right on the money, and the feel is firm but deep and layered. Offers fine character and ageability. A blend of Malbec from three top vineyards; drink through 2014.","34460":"Earthy, leathery, stewed aromas are more savory than fruity. The palate on this Malbec-led blend is full, flush and resiny. Savory blueberry, Middle Eastern spice notes and oaky flavors reside in front of a roasted finish with grab and grip.","34470":"Floral berry and plum aromas are direct and pure, emphasizing fruit over oak. A punchy palate follows the nose, while bright plum and berry flavors complete the package. This captures the essence of Malbec while not going overboard.","34478":"Spicy, woody aromas of oak and root beer are equal to the black-fruit aromas this Malbec is offering. A mix of fresh acidity and creamy oak clash a bit on the palate. Flavors of herbal berry fruits and chocolate finish with rubbing tannins, a flavor note of hickory, and a hint of toasty mint.","34589":"A deep, developed wine with cola, licorice and prune aromas. The palate is poised and balanced even if it's rich and very ripe. Layered in the mouth, with plum, prune, chocolate, coffee and fine spice, which is about as complete a package as you'll find with Malbec. Cabernet and Syrah; drink now through 2015.","34716":"Jammy raspberry and plum aromas come with accents of dusty herbs and black licorice. A saturated, lush, jammy palate features soft, baked flavors of cassis and wild berry, while the finish delivers mint, chocolate and lasting berry ripeness. Drink through 2019.","34724":"Opaque to the eye, this is rich, heady and full of inky blackberry aromas and notes of graphite, balsam wood, tobacco and coconut. A lush, mile-deep palate offers chocolaty flavors of blackberry, roasted meat and salt. Ripe black-fruit flavors dominate a lush finish. Drink through 2020.","34808":"A full, oily nose with aromas of orange blossom and lychee turns more fleshy and mealy with airing. This has a plump, flush body and flavors of lime, orange and white table grapes. A citrusy finish is fruity but doesn't glide.","34823":"Bold, gritty, balsamic berry aromas are rubbery and saucy in nature. Edgy and grating on the palate, but also full of spunk, this tastes salty. Modest red-berry flavors finish oaky and rustic, with a lasting note of aged balsamic vinegar.","34856":"Asphalt and gaseous aromas take a while to settle, but after they do, leather and scratchy blackberry scents surface. It feels big and brawny, with max extraction. It tastes masculine but salty, with bitter chocolate and peppery accents. Bulky for $11 wine.","34883":"Concentrated savory aromas of prune, blackberry, compost and tree bark are not uncommon for Colom\u00e9. This is a clampy tannic Malbec that pulls down hard on the palate. Salty savory plum and berry flavors are oaky and finish with tannic residue. Drink through 2022.","34958":"This opens with a blast of funky, jumpy wild berry. The palate feels fresh, with a lot of fruit, acid and extract. It tastes saturated, big and grapy, with herb-influenced wild-berry and animal notes.","34965":"The nose is jammy and slightly medicinal at first, but then plum and berry aromas settle. This feels firmly tannic and mouthfilling, with baked berry and roasted plum flavors. The finish is hard and strapping, with excess power.","34967":"Red licorice, rhubarb and green herb aromas are balanced by toast, spice and berry notes. The palate feels hard and dense, with herbal berry and olive flavors. Chocolate and additional herbal flavors carry the finish.","34985":"Floral blueberry aromas work alongside baking-spice notes on an inviting nose. This feels fresh and jumpy, with live-wire acidity. Leafy plum and lightly herbal flavors finish fresh and snappy, with juicy acidity and no overt oak. Drink through 2019.","35058":"Big, lush and tightly structured, with cola and mocha aromas along with serious black fruit power and brightness. A pure and delicious Malbec-Cabernet wine with the full allotment of berry character, cola accents, dark spice and clarity. Drink now through 2014.","35081":"Woodsy spice, clove and chocolate announce the oak that is the lead factor throughout the wine. The nose is creamy and resiny green, with vanilla yogurt, plum and berry flavors coming next. Solid in terms of acidity and feel, but a little bit lactic due to the wood treatment.","35094":"Red berry fruit with touches of vanilla and spice give this bargain-priced Pinot a candied but inviting set of aromas. The palate runs on fresh fruit, and overall it's all about clean, forward juicy flavors and very little extra. A nice aperitif Pinot Noir.","35156":"Initial charred aromas yield to aggressive cherry and maple scents. This is a wide, fully tannic load of a Malbec with toasty flavors of burnt wheat bread and maple to go with blackberry and cassis. Toast remains on the finish, which also tastes of licorice. Drink through 2023.","35180":"Deep and sultry aromas of black fruit, mineral and toast mix with licorice gum drop and leather to form a good bouquet. The palate, however, runs more sharp than expected, with high acidity propelling lean, narrow pie-cherry flavors. A bit hollow but fresh and pure. Starts better than it ends. 70% Malbec and 30% Corvina.","35262":"Smells volatile and balsamic, much like salad dressing. There's no doubting this wine is Cab Franc\u2014it's herbal and foresty, with a soft mouthfeel and herbal berry flavors topped off by oregano and basil. A rustic wine that's probably too herbal for most palates.","35274":"High-toned citrus aromas lead to a sharp, spritzy palate with pithy flavors and lots of zest. Doesn't taste like much besides tangy lime and citrus.","35287":"This murky Malbec has odd, horsey, berry aromas. It's rough and raw on the palate, with leafy, herbal plum flavors that finish rugged and with a dull spiciness.","35291":"A strange one from start to finish, this opens with unusual floral aromas that include orange peel and vanilla cookie. The palate is flat-out messy, with jammy weight. Herbal, odd flavors of blueberry and cardamom finish heavy, with raisin and licorice notes.","35311":"This Malbec's high-toned floral aromas of plum and blueberry come in front of a raw, abrasive palate. This tastes like pickled cranberry, while a citric finish is an enamel-peeler.","35312":"Tropical fruit and vanilla-cookie aromas come with a note of nectarine. This feels juicy, racy and citric, with flavors of tangerine and nectarine. Despite having tangy acidity, the wine turns heavy on the finish.","35333":"Light, citrusy aromas also are suggestive of bath soap. The feel is juicy yet innocuous, while flavors of tropical fruits finish mild and simple. This is the definition of a quaffing wine.","35350":"Wild berry and meaty sausage aromas introduce a creamy, concentrated palate. Jammy cassis flavors have a peppery edge, while the finish is toasty at first, transitioning to bitter.","35373":"Winemakers H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Garcin and Patrice Lev\u00eaque have coaxed a ton of character from 70-year-old Malbec and Cabernet vines, and the result is juicy but dark, with asphalt and tar aromas sitting in front of tight but generous black fruit (cassis and blackberry). Finishing notes of coffee, mocha and char leave you happy.","35501":"Oaky, smoky aromas are New World all the way. Heavily toasted and creamy on the palate, this hefty full-bodied Chardonnay tastes of wood resin, spiced apple and peach. Solid acidity keep this in line, while a lasting wave of toasty oak pushes the finish.","35525":"Matias Riccitelli keeps the hits coming with this concentrated, extracted Malbec that looks like crude oil and smells like baked black fruits. Chunky, tannic and massive on the palate, this tastes of prune, black tea and licorice. A ripe medicinal finish with controlled heat is tannic and a bit tough to wade through. Drink through 2020.","35586":"Ripe raisiny aromas of spiced fruit cake are heavy and sweet. Matching the nose, this Bonarda feels thick and chunky with grating tannins. Flavors of chocolaty black fruits are oaky, spicy and minty, while this is equally woody on the finish.","35588":"Gritty plum and berry flavors are a touch rough. This is tight on the palate, but fair. Dry flavors of minty oak and clove are more out front than salty berry notes, while this is firm and tastes like roasted fruit, oak and salted tomato on the finish.","35617":"Minty and toasty upfront, this is layered with blackberry, licorice, leather and toast aromas. It feels raring and ready to go, courtesy of firm acidity and good overall framing. Flavors of wild berry are bright, with herb and oak accents. Long, toasty and solid on the finish.","35628":"Quite spicy, with the Syrah element offering a meaty, leathery quality that varietal Malbecs just don't have. The nose is rich, with some mocha giving it oaky warmth. the mouthfilling palate is packed with kirsch, cassis and blackberry, while the finish is smoky with some fiery heat. Needs another year or two to come together.","35701":"Grapy, meaty aromas are loud and all over the map. The palate of this purple Cafayate Malbec is saturated and loaded with pulp, tannins and bulk. Roasted blackberry and cured-meat flavors finish mellow and soft, without much length.","35786":"Natural and oak-based spice aromas accent tarry black cherry, blackberry and gritty, toasty scents. Full and chewy on the palate, this tastes oaky, with fully toasted blackberry flavors. A spicy, resiny, oak-heavy finish is right for this wine. Drink through 2019.","35791":"There's plenty to like in this Tupungato Malbec, but since it was made from young vines, it's limited in depth, with angularity to the palate. Flavors of spicy plum and berry come with substantial oaky support, while the finish is lively, bouncy and holding onto its acidity. This may not improve but it's definitely not fading; drink through 2024.","35823":"Ripe berry and plum aromas are full and good. This Malbec has an easy mouthfeel that's weighty but well defined, with modest tannins and integrated acidity. Ripe cassis and berry flavors finish with a touch of creamy oak.","35869":"Although this is grassy and wiry smelling, there's enough ripe raspberry and red plum aromas to make the grade. A zesty, choppy feeling palate features plum, pie cherry and leafy berry flavors in front of a racy finish with decent follow through. This is 60% Malbec and 40% CS.","36022":"Aromas of red plum, herbs, smoky leather and toast crust unveil this Cab Franc with 5% Malbec. An expansive palate is the opposite of restrained, while this tastes earthy and spicy, with herbal cherry, plum and cassis flavors. A dry, composed, lightly herbal finish is a fine conclusion. Drink through 2022.","36073":"Red berry, sweet cherry and ripe plum aromas come with a touch of leather. The palate feels a bit sharp and acidic, with tangy, juicy flavors of plum and wild berry as well as some stalkiness. Cleansing and long on the finish thanks to high acidity.","36087":"Opens with aromas of black cherry and waves of resiny oak. Has good body and grabby barrel tannins along with a palate that deals dark berry flavor and even more oakiness. Tastes resiny and saucy on the finish; cleans up as it airs.","36371":"Smoky, spicy aromas are highly wood-driven, which creates hickory and campfire scents rather than discernible fruit. This feels a touch sticky and soupy, while baked, woody berry, black plum and cassis flavors are charred prior to a spicy, chunky finish.","36508":"Stalky, leathery aromas are low on fruit and freshness. This has a grabby feel, sort of like leather straps. Herbal berry and plum flavors are mildly bitter, while a green note is apparent on the finish. 90+? Not exactly.","36523":"Jammy berry and raisin aromas are compact and tell a lot about what's coming next. That's a saturated but rough and tannic palate with extremely ripe flavors of prune, licorice and blackberry jam. A peppery, syrupy finish is anything but lean.","36559":"Aromas of plastic and weedy berry fruits are not a draw. This feels dilute and pulling. Weedy, raw, tart red-berry flavors finish with green notes of mint and leafy herbs.","36564":"Aromas of herbal berry are green and leafy. This feels wiry, lean and scouring due to sharp acidity and not much body. Stewy, herbal, candied berry flavors finish with a distinct herbal green character.","36566":"Grassy, herbaceous, raisiny aromas are green and harsh. This is brutally tannic and out of whack on the palate, while green, weedy flavors finish thick, blocky and rough.","36568":"Gritty aromas of asphalt, licorice and especially clove are off the beaten path. Flavors of dried clove, pepper and wood smoke are dominant and don't allow for any fruit to show through. A finish that tastes like pure clove is in its own zip code. Tasted twice.","36576":"Smoky, rubbery, heavily oaked aromas sit on top of a stocky, creamy palate. This blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah is plump and candied, with hickory, bacon and generic black-fruit flavors resting on lemony acidity.","36591":"Reduced, condensed aromas of jammy berry fruits are herbal and narrow. In the mouth, this Cabernet-Malbec blend is wiry, rubbery and pinched. Flavors of prune, fig, black cherry and oregano finish blocky, with raw residual tannins.","36656":"Charred blackberry aromas carry a minerally note. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah feels tight and drawing, although with time in the glass it lessens its grip. Meaty, savory, oaky notes top core blackberry flavors, while this takes on a sauvage note along with a can't-miss flavor of wood grain on the finish. Drink through 2022.","36699":"Floral aromas of orange peel, rose petal and violet blend with more typical scents of tar and char. This Malbec blend is linear in feel but full, without an ounce of flab. Lightly spiced berry, red plum and chocolaty oak flavors finish toasty and tight, but with give. Drink 2017\u20132023.","36721":"Earthy berry aromas come with a note of balsam wood, tobacco and soy sauce. This is juicy, with sinewy tannins and a sense of perpetual hardness to the palate. Lightly herbal blackberry and plum flavors exhibit a stalky note. Toasty and tannic on the finish. Drink through 2022.","36722":"Warm, earthy, slightly horsey berry aromas are brambly and spicy. This Malbec feels flush but reduced and hard at the edges. Potent but crude boysenberry and plum flavors show a raisiny note, while this is long at the end, with earth notes and lemon peel. Drink through 2018.","36723":"Fiery cherry, blackberry, spice, toast and animal aromas lead to a racy, intense, narrow palate. Plum, blackberry and peppery flavors finish with toastiness, spice and juicy acidity that highlights the high tones in this blend of three Malbec vineyards. Drink through 2022.","36731":"Smoky, roasted aromas of hickory and foresty berry fruits roll onto a palate that's bright and lifted by acidity. Oaky, spicy flavors of vanilla and mocha accent berry fruit, while a juicy finish with bold acidity and smoky, toasty notes of new oak closes this out. Drink through 2021.","36745":"A fully ripe bouquet brushes up against raisin notes but pulls back. This feels juicy and full of life. Flavors of toasty, spicy plum and cassis roll onto a rugged, slightly hot finish with chocolaty spice and lasting berry intensity. Drink through 2021.","36749":"Purple, smoky and dense but beyond that it's regular. The palate is racy and medium deep, but the flavors are more superficial than interesting. Finishes quick, with coffee and bitter chocolate flavors.","36755":"Heady plum and dark berry aromas give a warning of size and ripeness, and indeed there's a ton of ripe fruit to the palate; but the wine is also raw, untamed and lacking in mouthfeel. It could stand to flow and finish better than it does.","36763":"Quite piercing on the nose, with unyielding cherry and hard-spice aromas. The palate is also intense, with saturated black cherry and raspberry flavors riding rough on a tight frame. Not the most friendly and easy Malbec.","36764":"Citrus blossom and pine notes are welcoming enough, but the palate is sort of sweet and gummy for Torrontes. The wine has a spritzy body but not much variety in flavor. Powdery on the finish, with sugary leftovers.","36786":"After whiffs of burnt rubber and char blow off, this berry-packed Cabernet hits like a small brick with black fruit flavor, which packs punch and aftershocks of cocoa and coffee. Chunky, rough and warm.","36875":"Dark, ripe, tarry aromas announce a macho Malbec. This is jammy and pulpy in texture, with more than enough extraction. Herbal, woodsy black-fruit flavors are supported by an oaky, resiny finish with black-pepper spice notes. Drink through 2018.","36878":"Black-fruit aromas are accented by notes of licorice, green herbs and grass. This is full and chunky, but a bit hollow in mouthfeel. Pronounced tartaric acidity results in surface-level pop along with hollowness, while lactic oak and coconut flavors on the finish are familiar for Argentine Cabernet.","36911":"Dark, burnt, crusty aromas lead to a palate with choppy tannins. Spicy, rooty, peppery flavors of red bell pepper, tomato and plum finish spicy, peppery and savory, with a burst of freshening acidity that adds energy and jump.","36915":"This mature, yeasty sparkler from Mendoza smells of brioche and baked apple. Flavors of sourdough bread, cider and white mushroom finish bready and soft, so drink now.","36925":"This music-themed blend of Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc is named after vinyl records, and the name means \u201cwhite noise.\u201d The nose is made up of simple apple and stone-fruit aromas, and the wine tastes of briny orange, finishing racy and salty.","37072":"This big, lush, friendly and serious Malbec is packed with prune, blackberry and toast aromas. On the palate, it's deep and layered, the perfect bed for flavors of blackberry, chocolate and herb to fill. Huge for sure, but still complex, with dynamite prune and licorice notes on the finish. Drink now\u20132015.","37129":"Chewing gum, dry wood and generic berry aromas precede an honest palate with modest tannins. Slightly herbal black-fruit flavors are peppery but nonspecific. A steady but chunky finish is the final act.","37135":"Briary berry aromas come with hints of leather and animal. This feels dense, jammy and a bit gummy, while flavors of blueberry, chocolate and baked black plum finish chewy and a touch sticky.","37226":"This is a dark, rich, modern Cabernet. The nose oozes sweet aromas of coconut and vanilla along with creamy oak and blackberry. The palate is full and chunky in feel, with dark-fruit flavors accented by molasses and pepper. A chewy finish shows grip and lasting acidity.","37365":"Generic red-fruit aromas are accented by sage and thyme, while in the mouth the feel is wiry. Full-blooded raspberry and cherry flavors come with pronounced acidity and lighter-framed tannins, so there's some sharpness. All in all it's a no-frills red wine with minimal Cabernet character.","37366":"Toso's first-ever ros\u00e9 of Malbec comes in a salmon color, with clean but generic aromas of melon, cotton candy and wet stones. The palate deals sweet peach with some spice, and the mouthfeel is full. Good in a round, drink-me-soon style.","37513":"Red-fruit aromas operate solo on the bouquet. This feels tight, crisp and fresh, with plum, berry and peppery spice flavors. A dry, slightly abrasive and scratchy finish deals juiciness and lasting red-fruit flavors.","37517":"Dusty apricot and melon aromas come with plenty of oak and vanilla. The palate is on the flat and creamy side, with peachy acidity. Flavors of mild citrus, vanilla and wood resin finish with additional vanilla notes and a hint of papaya.","37523":"Stewy, baked aromas of raisin and prune boldly announce that this Malbec is ripe to the point of overripe. The palate is syrupy and soft; cooked, baked flavors of blackberry syrup finish  sticky, stewy and slightly bitter.","37577":"Cool herbal aromas of blackberry and cola are minty. This feels narrow, with hard tannins that aren't ready to reconcile now. Herbal salty flavors of meaty berry fruits are warm, spicy and steadfast with herbal notes through the finish. Drink through 2020.","37684":"Spice, mint, herb, raspberry and currant aromas form a good nose. Things run a bit choppy and rough on the palate, but overall it works, bearing roasted berry and herb influences, with grabby tannins. This is a full, stocky, spicy and mildly green-leaning Cabernet.","37723":"Golden in color, with a nose of gardenia, green herb and lychee. This feels solid, but it's softening, with adequate grip despite no overt acidity. It tastes peachy and oily. Drink immediately.","37728":"This is superdark and savory smelling, with aromas of cumin, char, roasted blackberry and licorice. Big tannins and beaming acids structure the palate, which bears toasty, oaky flavors of berries. The finish is spicy and salty.","37730":"On the nose, aromas of sweet, red hard candy mingle with a note of animal fur. Fairly tannic and lively in the mouth, this has herbal, rubbery flavors alongside jumpy red-berry fruit. The finish is a bit abrasive.","38069":"Floral berry, olive and spice aromas make for a rustic nose with polish. This wine feels lively and a bit jumpy, with woody plum and berry flavors that are braced and framed by crisp Patagonian acidity. A lightly herbal, salty finish is powerful but steady. Drink through 2020.","38078":"Big, bold blackberry and mulled-plum aromas are ripe, briary and turn more raisiny the longer this wine sits. Raw, tart acidity and firm tannins offer structure. This wine has a palate of prune and stewed meat, with a rich yet rugged feel. Drink through 2021.","38215":"This has fresh berry and flower aromas that lead to a healthy-feeling palate, which is full of cherry, boysenberry and blackberry flavors. Mildly toasty and chocolaty on the finish.","38271":"Inky, dark, charred and serious, and it only gets better as it opens with air. The palate has a smooth, deep, comfortable feel and the flavors are sweet, fruity, creamy and proper for Malbec. Chocolaty and rich on the finish. A very nice wine made for near-term drinking.","38390":"Chewing gum, dry wood and generic berry aromas precede an honest palate with modest tannins. Slightly herbal black-fruit flavors are peppery but nonspecific. A steady but chunky finish is the final act.","38511":"Dry spice and minty aromas cover up mild berry fruit scents. This is clunky and jammy in feel, with stewed berry and saucy flavors. The finish is herbal in general, with a chunky weight to it.","38512":"Earthy aromas are a bit muddled and suggest tomato and herbs, but in the mouth, this is fresh and rigid in feel. Flavors of zesty berry come with oaky, savory notes and a touch of woody residue on the finish.","38530":"Minty boysenberry aromas show modest minerality. The palate feels acidic and clipped, while angular berry flavors lead the charge. A minty, peppery finish comes with scouring acidity, so this needs food.","38621":"A touch of green is present on the bouquet, while cassis and raspberry aromas fill in the blanks. The palate is creamy and a touch sticky, with raspberry, plum and coconut flavors. A good wine with limitations; it's smooth but unctuous, with a full mouthfeel and good, familiar flavors.","38710":"Broad, woody, buttery aromas blend with blackberry, cassis and grapy notes on a full-force bouquet. This Uco Valley Malbec is lush, fruity and chunky in feel, with ripe, spicy, earthy flavors of blackberry and fresh herbs. A long, woody, toasty finish confirms high quality, length and power; drink through 2022.","38716":"Early on this shows edgy, minty aromas of toasty oak, but then plum, wild berry, warm dust and malty notes settle in. Chunky, grapy weight makes for a full, broad palate, while baked berry and savory meat flavors end dark, potent and satisfying. Drink through 2030.","38791":"This is one exotic number. The nose shows blueberry, boysenberry, charcoal, plenty of oak and hints of cardamom and star anise. A lush, layered palate is intense but doesn't hit too hard, while concentrated blackberry, licorice and spice flavors set up a peppery, minty finish that's stout and structured.","38795":"Opaque in color, this saturated Malbec-led blend exhibits coconut and cola aromas along with fully ripe blackberry notes. This is massive in the mouth, with a solid foundation. Maximum berry expression and a jammy, deep-fruited finish give this power and content beyond its price point.","38810":"Fabre Montmayou has excelled in the value department, but this higher-end Patagonian Malbec signals a new benchmark for this French-owned winery. This is dark and inky, with a crusty, blackened essence. Ripe black-fruit flavors come with chocolate, spice and licorice accents that run through a long, generous finish.","38944":"Mildly stewed berry aromas come with loud oak and a strong hint of green herbs. This Cab Franc feels syrupy and chunky, with baked flavors of berry fruits and oaky chocolate. That theme of oak and chocolate carries over to the finish.","39010":"Stalky green aromas lead to a palate that has a choppy feel combined with lactic notes. Flavors of stewy red fruits and resiny oak finish minty and with vegetal character.","39012":"Scratchy aromas of red fruits come with a chemical note of paint that feels hard and forced. Vanilla-like oak collides with green notes and bitterness that lead to a buttery finish.","39013":"Stalky, leathery aromas of cooked berry fruits precede a raw, acid-driven mouthfeel and sour flavors softened by a touch of malty oak. The finish is scouring and short.","39016":"The wine shows a maderized color and aromas of oxidized stone fruits and rubber. This fast-fading ros\u00e9 feels flat, with mushy flavors of peach, melon and mushroom. Bitterness rises up on the finish.","39024":"This is a supreme small-lot Argentine wine from lauded winemaker Jorge Riccitelli. The blend is 70% Malbec with 20% Cabernet and 10% Merlot. Aromas of loam, wild berry and vanilla are elegant and exciting. This is silky smooth, with creamy oak and ripe black-fruit flavors playing together through a mellow, plush finish. Drink this impressive, complete Malbec blend through 2016.","39157":"Barda is a particular wine with proprietary aromas of light cranberry, pickle brine, dried leaf and especially tomato. A light palate with mild yet rubbery tannins sets up fresh, earthy, briny flavors that end smooth, with salty, herbal aftershocks.","39320":"Murky, stewy, soupy aromas deliver little to no freshness or fruit, while the palate is tannic and tastes bitter, mildly weedy and minty. Seems roasted and devoid of quality. Unclean and unimpressive.","39501":"Blackberry, raisin, cola, moss and spice aromas form a potpourri of Malbec excellence. This is super deep and dense stuff; it's tight and ripped with tannins and acids. Flavors of licorice, blackberry, dark plum and oak are layered and serious. The first Mai made by Kaiken, and it's ready now through 2016.","39509":"Spunky right off the bat, this has floral and fresh fruit aromas that fall squarely into the wild berry category. It feels lively on the palate, with spiked acidity but enough weight and depth to absorb it. This tastes like a mix of plum, blackberry and chocolate, and the finish darkens up with notes of pepper and spice. Drink now\u20132017.","39701":"A lightly charred, foresty nose includes aromas of blackberry, cassis, hard spices, licorice and leather. This is lively but balanced in terms of feel, with richness and raciness playing off each other. Flavors of baked black fruits, peppery spice and licorice finish dark, long and bright, with juicy acidity that will keep this healthy for years to come. Drink through 2024.","39717":"A combination of char, licorice, blackberry and cassis aromas is about as complete and pleasing as it gets for Malbec. This doesn't lose it in the mouth, where things are firm and true, with solid tannins. Charred flavors carry onto the flavor profile along with blackberry and hickory smoke, while the finish is toasty, chocolaty and spicy. Drink through 2021.","39750":"Light, tropical aromas are mellow and reflect the 15% Riesling that helps out the wine's core of Torront\u00e9s. A tangy mouthfeel is citrusy and fresh, while flavors of lime, lychee and tangerine finish lively, clean and not bitter.","39837":"Shiny pink in color, with youthful, crisp aromas of cherry and watermelon. Zesty and fresh on the tongue, with spunky cherry and raspberry flavors that finish with natural sweetness. Candied to an extent, but mostly it's fresh and balanced.","39838":"Orange blossom, nectarine and almond skin aromas are true to the grape and inviting. The palate maintains a light, juicy, citric feel as it delivers flavors of melon, apple and banana. Fresh and forward, with a hint of heat and bitterness to the finish.","39873":"Melon and stone-fruit aromas are minerally and mild, with no overt fruit or oaky aromas sticking out. Crisp, citric and still a touch oily in feel, this tastes of briny citrus fruits, popcorn and salt. On the finish, this shows good body along with lasting salty citrus flavors.","39883":"Soupy berry aromas with cheesy oak notes make for an earthy, challenging nose. This feels full, grabby and highly tannic. Medicinal berry and cherry flavors are accented by brown-sugar sweetness and chocolaty spice on the finish.","39920":"Olive, blackberry and toasty oak all give hope, but when this wine crosses the palate the acidity is so intense that it causes you to take count of your cheeks, tongue and teeth. On one hand, there's blackberry and cassis flavors to enjoy; on the other, the mouthfeel leaves you roughed up. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.","40071":"The ultimate patio\/terrace wine has been found, and it's Urban from O. Fournier. True as can be, with lychee, acacia and green melon aromas and flavors, this wine is plump but refreshing, with honest Cafayate character. Maybe the best under-$10 white wine being made in Argentina.","40073":"Big and strong, with full but easy black-fruit aromas. Ripeness is where it should be, as cassis and berry flavors work the consistent palate before giving way to a medium-long finish. Along the way there are hints of herbs, coffee and cherry cough drop.","40169":"Saline-based aromas suggest sea shells, accompanied by notes of vanilla and stone fruits. This wine has a lively yet full palate that fits the Tupungato style. A layer of oak flavor sits atop pineapple, melon and peach notes. It's woody and tastes of honeyed tropical fruits on the finish.","40171":"Savory, grapy aromas include gamy notes and an herbal influence. A choppy, abrupt palate is gravelly in feel. Herbal plum and cranberry flavors are meaty and a touch green on the finish. For a Malbec that's not just about black fruits and oak, give this a shot.","40192":"Black cherry, blackberry and marzipan aromas are full, lusty and inviting. This has a chewy, full-bodied and layered mouthfeel to go with the dark-fruit flavors that are aided by spice notes. A peppery chocolaty finish is solid, ripe and friendly. Drink through 2020.","40193":"Deep cool aromas of cola and toast blend with sweeter notes of maple and blackberry on this lush full-bodied Malbec. Flavors of blackberry, boysenberry, coffee, mocha and black pepper finish nicely on a well-cut, well-proportioned finish. Drink through 2020.","40194":"Grainy woody aromas of vanilla and pencil lead control the nose of this saturated blend of Malbec and Cab Franc. At a whopping 15.8% abv, one shouldn't be shocked by syrupy weight and head-to-toe sweetness. Additional flavors of maple, char and baked black fruits finish heavy, with notes of burnt toast and black licorice. Drink through 2021.","40215":"Lusty, deep Malbec from Patagonia. The nose is a puddle of rich berry, spice and chocolate, while the palate is snappy and alert even if the flavors veer toward roasted black fruits, sweetness, cola and saut\u00e9ed mushroom. A bit tannic and biting on the finish, with earth and oak standing out.","40216":"Intense and extracted but also well balanced and smooth, with minerality and asphalt on the nose. The palate mixes deep black fruit weight and flavors with snappy acids, and overall this is bright, bullish and full of berry and black cherry along with chocolate. A ripe, satisfying wine for the money.","40224":"Fairly large, dark and extracted, but also lush and rich, with aromas of raisin and stewed blackberry. The palate is rich to the point of almost being heavy, while the flavors of blackberry and roasted black plum are mildly leathery and salty. Nice, big, meaty and tasty for the price.","40250":"At 50% Cab and 50% Malbec, this wine runs outside the mainstream for Argentina. It's dark in color but slightly green and stemmy on the nose. The palate offers a solid mouthfeel with flavors of baked berry fruit, earth and carob. It's sweet at its core, but mildly bitter and candied on the finish. Good but struggles to find a pleasurable sweet spot.","40254":"Nice enough but not all that varietal in terms of aromas, flavors or anything. There's big red and black fruit aromas and flavors along with firm tannins, extract and some pepper. It's rich and chewy, but also tannic and fairly regular. For the price it should not disappoint.","40273":"Quite neutral and distant on the nose, with dry apple flavors working the soft, balanced palate. There are complexities such as white pepper and nutty nuances, but in the end it's an average sparkler with a controlled approach. Good for Argentina but probably not ready to compete with the world's best $20 sparkling wines.","40337":"Oily, match-stick aromas are none too friendly, and not a lot improves as this unfolds. The palate is adequate in feel, but the flavors are bitter and oily, while the finish is nothing but bitter.","40430":"Grapy aromas of violet petal and blackberry are gritty and earthy. This feels outright tannic and edgy. Herbal, lightly green flavors of roasted black fruits settle on chocolate, spice and more herbs on a powerful but hot finish.","40576":"Full berry aromas are fresh but come with a lot of oak and spice. In the mouth, this Syrah (with 3% Viognier) is chewy and a bit syrupy, with minty, spicy flavors derived from loud oak. On the finish, it dries out and turns warm-to-hot as it fades away. A joint-venture wine between Trapiche and Joey Tensley of California.","40881":"Dusty citrus aromas show a hint of butterscotch. This feels about right, with modest lift coming from mild acidity. Dry simple flavors of white pepper and generic bitterness close this out.","40888":"Minty oak aromas are the greeting on this herbal and foxy Malbec that feels crisp and chippy due to high acidity and grating tannins. Flavors of herbal berry and plum are oaky and a touch hot, while rubbery tannins and herbal berry leftovers drive the finish.","40962":"Burnt popcorn and some ammonia make the nose fairly harsh. Time softens it a bit as it yields to green-fruit flavors. Finishes dry as a soda cracker, with some Old World touches. Not an easy wine to enjoy; it's very lean and underdeveloped.","41004":"Nice berry aromas feature a smidgen of spice and herbs, while the palate has forward acidity that props up lively berry flavors. Expect no frills and this big-format Merlot will satisfy. It's ripe and sweet, and overall it's done right.","41005":"For two years running this Torrontes is White Pearl's most praiseworthy wine. It is true and tasty, with flowery aromas leading to flavors of lychee, papaya, melon and grass. Decent body and length give it credibility as a 1.5L Best Buy.","41082":"Aromas of blueberry and raspberry are floral and exotic, which is usual for Cafayate wines. This has a chunky, grapy mouthfeel and fruit-cake flavors of stewed berry and plum along with spice notes. A jammy feeling finish is low on structure.","41126":"Black currant and plum aromas come with a defined streak of minty green. The palate, meanwhile, feels boxed in by tannic grip. Flavors of prune, mint and herbal berry lead to an edgy finish with the flavors of carob and herbs.","41127":"Smoky up front, with lightly herbal berry and plum aromas but also leafiness and scratchiness. Has grip and structure, but tastes roasted and meaty, with raw oak and spice flavors leading to a minty, oaky, grabby finish.","41129":"Dark in color, an indicator that this is a ripe style of Pinot. Smells granular and earthy, its big berry fruit aromas leading to a full-bodied palate with sweet black fruit flavors. Offers good acidity and plenty of oak.","41130":"On the first pass the wine smells rubbery and minty, with a note of green herbs poking through. Gets jammier and fruitier with airing, and in the mouth it's blocky and resiny, with herb-infused flavors of berry and plum accented by lactic oak. Finishes sweet, muscular and sticky.","41174":"This is heady and savory smelling, with a mild burnt-leaf component to the bouquet. The palate is stacked to the max, and dense in feel, with toast, espresso, hickory and baked berry flavors. On the finish, a hazelnut note blends with chocolate, licorice and toasted flavors.","41237":"More salady and green than you'd expect, with hints of vinaigrette and chunky berry on the nose. The palate is more syrupy and creamy than we'd like to see, with green-ish berry flavors followed by a finish of milk chocolate and bramble. Kind of mauling in terms of feel.","41265":"Calm, foresty, complex and inviting on the bouquet, with catchy berry and spice aromas. It's round, balanced and healthy in the mouth, with cola, dried herb, cassis and blackberry flavors. Chocolaty and oaky on the finish, but dry and proper. Almost identical to Qaramy's basic blend of Malbec, Cab and Syrah. Drink now.","41267":"Chocolate and charcoal aromas form a dark and masculine greeting. There's also coffee and an herbal note to the nose. Lush but not heavy, tannic or plodding, with powerful black fruit and herbal flavors. Runs deep and long on the finish; impressive.","41339":"Gritty aromas of asphalt, herbs, tomato and plum make for a tough opening. This is syrupy and grabby on the palate, with creamy berry and cooked brown-sugar flavors. A sinewy finish tastes medicinal and a touch weedy.","41381":"This dark-looking Cabernet smells chunky, raisiny and earthy. In the mouth, it's dense and extracted but blocky and heavy. Roasted oaky blackberry flavors finish with tannic residue and an oak-based flavor of clove.","41386":"Jumbled jammy berry aromas lack specificity. This has a forceful tartaric mouthfeel that supports tart plum and currant flavors. Keeping things consistent, this is angular and acidic on the finish, with sour plum and racy berry flavors.","41392":"The foxy muddled berry aromas are puzzling. This Malbec blend feels narrow and pinched. Hollow lactic foxy red-fruit flavors are crisp but not fully convincing, while abrasive, hard-edged tannins scrape across the finish.","41397":"Earthy leathery berry and briar patch aromas are a touch tomatoey. This feels sturdy, but that's really all you can say about the mouthfeel. Peppery spicy red-berry flavors are a bit grassy on the finish.","41403":"Light plum and cherry aromas come with a note of bitter horseradish. This feels full and rubbery, with creamy cherry flavors that show an herbal side. On the finish, mild notes of green herbs share space with creamy weight and briny hints.","41451":"Rarely do you come across something like this: mature and complex Malbec from Cafayate. Earthy aromas of plum, prune, raisin and tobacco give this an Old World bouquet. Saturated but with enough acidity to maintain balance, this tastes rooty, chocolaty and earthy, with mocha, toast and toffee flavors on a heady finish. Drink now.","41477":"Aromas of hard spices, licorice root and earth override any berry fruit notes this Cabernet blend shows. Round on the palate, with juicy acidity, this tastes of plum and spicy oak. A long, woody, spicy finish brings it home.","41495":"Inky, oaky, saturated and a bit harsh up front, this is rock hard and tannic as nails, with rugged acidity added in. Flavors of black plum, rubber and resiny oak end with grapy berry notes, oversize acidity and tannic bite.","41633":"Cola, root beer and cherry aromas come with controlled heat. The palate is dense and chewy, with pumped-up tannins supporting very ripe-tasting cassis and cooked plum flavors. It's toasty and spicy on the firm finish.","41635":"This is fresh, showing plenty of pop on the fruit-filled bouquet. It feels wide and jammy, yet grabby and dry because of its firm tannins. Typical of Bonarda, it's full of ripe black-fruit flavors and licorice, while the structured finish makes for a good ending.","41706":"Loud, charred aromas start out gaseous but turn more elegant, peppery and lightly herbal with airing. This wine is ripe, deeply built and firm in feel; flavors of cassis and sweet, candied blackberry finish subtle and quietly long.","41718":"Pure is yet another addition to Trapiche's overflowing stable of Malbecs. This is big, grabby and shows chocolate, floral, herbal and perfumed berry aromas. A choppy but flush mouthfeel stages herbal-leaning, red-fruit flavors that carry a touch of green that's seconded on a minty, herbal, plump feeling finish.","41786":"Dry, mossy berry aromas carry punch, while this well-built Malbec feels concentrated but not heavy. Peppery, blackened berry flavors spill over with a black-coffee note on a slightly hot finish. Drink through 2020.","41788":"The aromatic greeting on this old-vines Cab is smooth, harmonious and elegant, with notes of plum, cassis, tobacco and fine oak. The palate is a bit high-pitched, with racy acidity, while flavors of herbs, tomato, spiced berry fruits and oak finish similar, with dry, drawing tannins. Drink through 2021.","41840":"This extracted Malbec blend deals full doses of blueberry, blackberry, balsamic vinegar, vanilla and mocha aromas. The palate weighs in on the jammy, overripe side, with almost no acidic cut. Soupy, ultraripe flavors of cr\u00e8me de cassis, carob and prune finish raisiny. Drink this syrupy wine through 2017.","41918":"Plump tropical fruit aromas show on the nose. A fruity but not complex palate deals short melon and tropical-fruit flavors prior to a briny finish.","41955":"Earthy aromas of cola, plum and blackberry come with a saline note. For the most part, this feels pure, good and fruity, albeit a bit rubbery. Short but solid blackberry and cassis flavors finish with mild oak and a touch of peppery spice.","41971":"Saucy and intense up front, this offers cheesy, grainy oak aromas along with stalky cassis and plum scents. Raw, choppy and fairly high in acidity, this tastes briny, herbal and woody, but also like raspberry and plum. Oak and herbal flavors carry the finish.","42037":"The best of the 2008 batch of Trapiche single-vineyard Malbecs is this one from Jorge Miralles' vineyard. Dark, smoky and elegant on the nose, with blackberry, cassis and toasty spice flavors. It's juicy, deep and balanced, with a long, sultry, smooth finish. Pure and showing nary a fault. Drink now through 2015.","42146":"Peachy aromas are friendly, while the palate has a good feel to it along with green flavors of melon, lime and fresh veggies. Finishes with fruit, dryness and a touch of bitterness, yet in the end it fails to deliver on the promise of the bouquet.","42151":"Big and blasting on the nose, with heat and burn. The palate is high-wire boysenberry and a lot of acid, and ultimately it borders on sour and fiery, which probably isn't the intention. Wiry and piercing for a pricey, 800-case-production Malbec.","42159":"Sweet and honeyed, but flat and cloying. Candied melon and citrus flavors run heavy and chunky, and the finish is more of the same. Big, ripe, sticky and sweet but definitely not elevated in class.","42163":"Tropical and mild smelling, with vague aromas of melon and lychee. The palate is very sweet and sticky, as if some residual sugar had been left in the wine. Cloying late, and while it hints at higher quality, it comes across candied.","42223":"Reedy weedy aromas include notes of motor oil and leafy berry fruits. This tastes as weedy as it smells, with underripe herbal berry flavors that never shed an overriding green essence.","42225":"This smells confected\u2014neither natural nor convincing. Vanilla and milk chocolate aromas recall a cheap ice cream sundae. This feels scattered and hollow. Plum and chocolate flavors taste artificial and forced.","42323":"Baked aromas of raisin are not uncommon for this winery's reds. This has Amarone-like weight backed by flavors of prune, black pepper and medicinal cherry. Heat is a factor on a grapy finish. This Cabernet-Malbec blend doesn't tread lightly.","42337":"This Malbec-Cabernet Franc blend is topped with heavy oak that lends a burnt, chemical character to the nose. Tight across the palate, with hard tannins, this tastes dry and oaky, with barrel-driven berry and cassis flavors. Dry, woody, edgy and a touch hot on the finish.","42491":"Cassis, mineral, floral notes and aromatic subtleties hint at sophistication and maturity. This is layered and well structured, with exotic spice flavors accenting oaky red-currant and plum notes. The finish is mellow, woody and fresh feeling. Drink now.","42525":"For a basic Chardonnay, this fits the bill. Citrus and peach aromas are standard and clean. The palate is tight and juicy, with no overt oak feel. Flavors of melon and pear have light spice and vanilla accents, while the finish is crisp.","42605":"This is peachy and a bit oily on the nose, but not harsh or pointed. It feels full and fleshy, with sweet, ripe flavors of melon, citrus and lychee. Long and melony on the finish; drink now.","42800":"Aromas of haystack and oiliness lead into a stalky flavor profile that centers on bitterness and pithy citrus. Salty notes, green melon and more bitterness work the finish.","42812":"Gold in color, with oxidized aromas of straw, almond skins, butterscotch and baked apple, this PG is fading fast. Flavors of apple and briny stone fruits finish with almondy notes and bitterness.","42814":"This red-tinted, full-bodied ros\u00e9 is strained on the nose, with a strong, distinct whiff of wet animal fur. The palate feels heavy and unfocused, while flavors of plum skins and nectarine finish bitter and without any crispness or cleansing properties.","42869":"Big, fresh, grapy aromas are the greeting on this nice but generic Malbec. The palate is plump and chunky yet bright and fruit-forward, with creamy flavors of dark plum and berry. A clean, focused, short finish functions as a good close.","42928":"A hint of orange escapes from an otherwise acrid, oily nose, while the flavors of nectarine, peach and lychee are pithy and bitter. Can't offer a whole lot of positives about this weird Viognier.","42935":"Light, transparent and candied with underdeveloped, boring flavors and a mild chemical harshness. Barely worth a look. 40,000 cases produced.","43036":"Berry and cherry aromas are friendly, clean and offer spice accents. This is full, ripe and tannic, with blackberry, dark spice and chocolaty flavors. Toasty menthol and hard spice notes on the finish confirm intensity and overall quality.","43091":"Chunky plum, berry and toasty campfire aromas are full and thick on this blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Merlot. The palate is stout and meaty, with pronounced but honest tannins. It tastes charred, with ripe berry, prune and chocolate undercurrents. Loses some of its spunk on the finish.","43127":"Grassy red berry and plum aromas lead to a lean, somewhat high-acid palate with herbal, oaky flavors of raspberry and plum that don't last that long. Fresh and healthy feeling on the finish, but tasting more of oak and spice than fruit.","43329":"Earthy, leafy aromas are backed by raspberry and cherry notes. This comes across firm and pinched, with a narrow mouthfeel defined by choppy tannins. A heavy oak flavor covers raspberry and plum accents, while the finish is dry and oaky.","43335":"Roasted, leathery aromas have a cheesy side that covers up the wine's fruit scents. This feels fresh but choppy and rough, while flavors of mint, plum and cassis finish peppery and a bit green and grassy.","43350":"Evident aromas of prune and raisin announce extreme ripeness. Like the nose, this feels ripe and chunky, with hard tannins. Jammy, extracted flavors of raisin and black plum are oaky and peppery prior to a pushy finish with heat.","43362":"Jumpy, bright berry and currant aromas come with a scent of wet dog fur. This is fresh but shallow, with simple, lively cherry and plum flavors. On the finish, this is easy and friendly but it evaporates quickly.","43558":"Reduced, jammy aromas of blueberry and bacon turn gritty with airing. This feels heavy, chunky and struggles for balance. Stewy, medicinal blueberry flavors finish sticky, with a mix of green, candied berry and caramel notes.","43566":"This is a rough, leathery and stalky Cabernet. Horseradish and leather aromas set up a lightly green, herbal and peppery flavor profile. While the wine feels pretty good, there's no escaping its green-leaning, stalky character.","43574":"This is a heavily oaked brew of 50% Viognier, 40% Chardonnay and 10% Riesling. The nose is woody to the max, with herbal notes of parsley and white flowers. A full, heavy, resiny palate is home to barrel-driven flavors of spice and clouded white fruits. On the finish, this tastes mostly of wood and resin.","43590":"Earthy, woody aromas of heavy berry fruits are tired. This has a chunky, soupy feel along with overripe flavors of raisin and roasted plum. A burnt-wood character akin to hickory controls the finish.","43598":"Prune is the most distinct aroma on a generic yet ripe nose. This feels shearing and high in acidity, while raspberry flavors fold in sharp tartaric notes. Short on the finish, as might be expected.","43630":"Herbaceous aromas of mint and catnip are heavy on the nose, which also gives off a note of licorice gumdrop. This Malbec is tight and raw in feel, while herbal, spicy plum and currant flavors finish somewhat green.","43634":"Strained, jumbled aromas of mustard, horseradish and green grass fail in many ways. This feels wide, edgy and tartaric, and thus overall balance is shaky. High acidity creates a sense of sourness, while this Tannat from Salta finishes choppy and acidic.","43637":"Heavily charred aromas throw a shadow over roasted, stalky red-berry notes. This feels tight, choppy and drawing, with no give to the palate. Roasted, salty plum and berry flavors end with a final round of hard, pounding tannins.","43640":"One whiff and you can tell this leans towards overripe. Aromas of raisin and baked berry fruits are stewy and cooked. This feels much like it smells: heavy and baked. Flavors of raisin and prune finish similar.","43652":"Powdery, oily aromas are like fruity bath soap. This feels more whole and round than edgy. Slightly salty flavors of melon and ham finish with decent acidity but not much depth or complexity.","43654":"Muddled, oily aromas are funky for certain. This blend of Riesling, Albari\u00f1o and Savagnin feels round and melony, but ultimately soft. Floral, pickled melon flavors come in front of a briny, tropical-leaning finish.","43689":"Sweet oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a jammy bouquet that also features black plum and blackberry scents. This blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat feels full, lifted and balanced. Ripe, enticing flavors of wild berry and cassis are backed by toast, chocolate, vanilla and coconut notes as well as heat and burn. Drink through 2019.","43744":"Baked plum and berry aromas are lusty and jammy. In the mouth, this is tannic and the acidity is citric in character. Flavorwise, A Lisa is pumping out brawny berry flavors matched by lemony oak notes, and the finish is expansive, with blanketing tannic grip. This will show best in late 2014, after it's had more time to settle.","43745":"Hickory and other wood-based aromas and flavors dominate this Amarone-style blend. Amid all the smokiness there's cola and vanilla aromas and thick, heavy, meaty flavors of baked black fruits offset by toast, spice and chocolate. A sweet-tasting, jammy feeling finish closes the show.","43768":"Wiry aromas of red plum and cherry are offset by deeper, more baked and stewy notes. This drills away with hard tannins and punchy acidity, while cherry, plum, mint and earthy flavors finish with baked, chocolaty power. The blend is 40% each of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, with 20% Merlot.","43817":"A conflicted and hence confounding wine. The nose is very oaky, but it's a pointed, almost piercing wood and clove bouquet. The wine is fierce in the mouth, with kicking tannins and acidity pushing bulldozer-like blackberry and bitter espresso flavors. With 6% Merlot, this Patagonian Malbec has its virtues but isn't as friendly as past vintages.","43962":"Floral red-fruit aromas are modest but clean. The palate is a bit chunky but overall it's in good shape. Flavors of berry and cassis are ordinary, but the flavor profile is perfectly good. A touch of chocolate and oak rise up on the finish.","43969":"This is woodsy, spicy and narrow in its delivery of berry aromas. The palate is lively and shows acidic pick up. Full, generous berry flavors fade quickly then finish with a wave of minty, medicinal wood character.","44031":"This is smoky and a touch fiery and woody on the nose. Fresh on the palate, with plenty of body and pulp, it bears full flavors of berries and a fair amount of wood-driven spices. The finish tastes oaky and slightly lactic.","44039":"The chiseled lemon-lime aromas are minerally and crisp, with a touch of lychee. This feels light on its feet but shows depth, with flavors of citrus, green herbs and lychee. It's smooth and fresh on the finish, with a green herb note.","44041":"This is jammy and bulky from the get-go, with heavy fruit aromas leading to a saturated, dense palate that feels thick. Baked, blackened flavors of sweet blackberry, chocolate and mocha mark the palate.","44044":"Dense and sweet up front, the nose is balanced and deep, with blackberry and graham cracker aromas. The palate feels grippy and concentrated, bearing blackberry, dark plum and black pepper flavors, with a lifted flower note. This finishes mild and spicy.","44045":"This opens with red fruit aromas that are wrapped around earth and leather scents, yielding a rustic whole. It feels snappy, with red fruit acidity leading to a gritty, lively palate, with flavors of brown sugar, red pepper, plum and raspberry. Long on the finish but short on texture.","44046":"Subtle and fairly deep, with aromas of berry, pastry and cherry cough drop. It feels lively and good, with blueberry and plum flavors in front of a textured, medium-deep finish.","44203":"Black fruit aromas come with a dusty note and a hint of milk chocolate. This feels straightforward, with flavors of raspberry, mild herb and sugar beet. The finish is short and easy, with an approachable mouthfeel.","44550":"Those familiar with Altocedro's Malbecs know that oak will be a key player. For this 200-case, small-batch wine, the nose offers a blast of barrel power that initially smells like a sawmill. The palate is bold and full, with flavors of buttery oak, vanilla and salty black fruits. There's grip to the finish, which, not surprisingly, tastes woody, dark and minty. Drink through 2022.","44600":"A wide net of aromas includes Band-Aid, peppercorn, vanilla, dill and dry, earthy plum. This is a full-bodied, creamy, oaky Pinot, with a leaning toward caramel, toffee and butter flavors. A full, sticky, mocha-tinged finish is baked in character, much like crumb cake.","44736":"Grapy aromas are spicy and woody. This is a full, packed truckload of a Malbec with earthy, baked flavors of blackberry and prune. Licorice and a mild blast of bitterness replace the wine's dark-fruit character on the finish.","44961":"Trapiche's Broquel is definitely one of Argentina's most consistent Bonardas. It opens with balsamic notes that accent chocolate and blackberry aromas, while the palate is sweet and steady as it delivers plum and ripe berry flavors. Good structure and feel, with just enough acidity to keep it in balance.","44993":"This is mellow up front, with mild aromas of melon and baby powder. It feels fresh and easygoing, with apple, citrus and vanilla flavors. Drink well chilled, and soon.","44999":"This opens with huge aromas of dark berry, cola and maple. The palate is ultratannic and grabby, with a sandpaper mouthfeel and big, boistrous flavors of black fruit. Syrupy and tannic on the finish, it has an overt rugged feel.","45040":"This lush, extracted Malbec oozes grapy aromas of blackberry and cassis. The palate matches the nose: it's intense and fully extracted. Toasty oak frames blackberry and marzipan flavors prior to a rich finish that's almost syrupy. This is a monster Malbec. Drink through 2022.","45050":"Pure, ripe blackberry aromas are heady, toasty and crisp like burnt bread crust. This Malbec has a profound, drawing mouthfeel defined by full extraction and muscular tannins. Savory flavors of blackberry and roasted plum end with depth, focus and welcome freshness. Drink through 2023.","45493":"Lush, classy aromas of balsam wood shavings, coconut, vanilla and dark-berry fruits open this hefty Malbec that spent two years in oak prior to bottling. A ripe thick palate maintains full-bodied balance, while this tastes dark, toasty and like a mix of chocolate, coffee and spiced blackberry. Peppery spice notes offset by mocha flavors are prominent on a saturated finish. Drink through 2022.","45525":"Gritty aromas of creosote, campfire and road tar are dark, woody and oaky. A clampy, angular palate deals firm tannins and acid-driven flavors of plum, berry and minty oak. A tarry tasting, peppery finish is loud and rugged.","45540":"Berry and cassis aromas turn more saucy with airing. This has a sticky mouthfeel with protruding acids, while flavors of plum and citrus finish short. This is good if you're looking for the basics.","45553":"Strawberry and herbal aromas are decent but a bit green. This has a jammy feel, with basic berry flavors that finish minty but fresh. Overall, this is a middle-of-the-road Malbec.","45588":"Grassy strawberry and raspberry aromas smell false as well as floral. A blocky palate with jammy stickiness and rubbery tannins carries medicinal, resiny, candied berry flavors, with green overtones. This feels raw on the finish while tasting green and jammy.","45671":"Violet, black cherry and berry aromas are elevated by mocha and coffee aromas, while the palate is deep and layered. Flavors of boysenberry and plum are creamy and rewarding, and the finish offers plenty of fruit in addition to oak. Maybe not super complex, but the wine's bold meatiness makes up for that. 1,000 cases produced.","45740":"Stout aromas of ripe blackberry and cassis come with mocha and dry spice notes on the nose of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon blend. A firm mouthfeel with grinding tannins is a good set up to oaky, ripe berry flavors accented by wood grain, cocoa and cinnamon notes. Plenty of oak graces a long, ripe, solid finish. Drink through 2018.","45855":"Asphalt and gaseous aromas take a while to settle, but after they do, leather and scratchy blackberry scents surface. It feels big and brawny, with max extraction. It tastes masculine but salty, with bitter chocolate and peppery accents. Bulky for $11 wine.","45911":"Oily citrus aromas offer side notes of air freshener and apricot. This atypical Chardonnay feels creamy and full, with mild acidity. Floral buttery leesy white-fruit flavors finish a bit soft. Drink now before it loses more steam.","45912":"Heavy oak, like the kind you get in a sawmill, is the opening on this Malbec-Bonarda blend, and that's supported by grapy aromas. Saturated, rough and bulky on the palate, this features massively spiced, lavishly oaked berry flavors that lead to a banging finish with scraping tannins.","45916":"Stone-fruit and melon aromas are a touch gritty and sulfuric. This light-colored racy Chardonnay is citrusy on the palate, with acidic grip and grab. Tangy citrusy buttercup flavors finish sturdy and steady.","45919":"Baked raisiny aromas are dominant and suggest overripeness. A heavy palate is rich but lacks flow and ease. Baked berry and raisin flavors are tasty but by now it's obvious that this lacks finesse and is off balance.","45974":"Dark in the glass, this has a moderately complex nose, with notes of black fruit, leather and spice. It feels tight, fresh and snappy, but not excessively wide or structured. Flavors of ripe berry and cocoa lead to a solid finish, which has a controlled, smooth feel. A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot.","45980":"A full blast of oak and related aromas open this creamy, ripe wine. Plump on the palate but with just enough acidity to preserve balance, this rich, friendly wine features walnut, papaya and citrus flavors that finish woody, smooth and long. Drink now.","46003":"Lush blackberry and boysenberry aromas are matched by cola and toast notes on this ripe blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Bonarda. The palate is flush and grabby, while saturated flavors of blackberry and black currant finish with power and toasty oak. Drink through 2019.","46044":"Solid berry and oak spice aromas turn darker and more rubbery as this airs out. A strong-boned, grabby palate holds medicinal berry and mild hickory flavors. On the finish, this is big but also tannic and bumpy.","46045":"Dusty peach aromas are round and hold up to scrutiny. This densely colored Malbec ros\u00e9 is ready to drink, with flavors of melon and peach. A touch of skins character adds complexity and texture to the finish. Drink immediately.","46048":"Ripe berry, toasty oak and vanilla notes drive the nose on this Salta Malbec. In the mouth, it is creamy and thick, with modest acidity. Oaky flavors of baked berry fruits and black currant finish jammy, soft and spicy, with a pervasive note of oak-based clove.","46056":"Heavy-handed oak on the nose is reflected through aromas of wet cement, char and wood resin. A grabby palate is full of oak tannin, while this tastes saucy and earthy, with savory berry and black-plum flavors. On the finish, the flavor of residual raw oak is strong.","46363":"Jammy blueberry and boysenberry aromas include graphite and ink notes. This feels jammy to the point of being sluggish and heavy. Syrupy but not sweet flavors of herbal black fruits finish with a lasting gamy note.","46411":"Strident aromas of licorice, herbs, berries and mint make it interesting, while the palate is light and fresh, with raspberry and red currant flavors. There's not a lot of heft, extract or depth to the wine, but it's likable and unhindered by excess oak and such. Enjoyable due to its unchallenging simplicity.","46421":"Given the dearth of good Argentinean ros\u00e9s on the market, this one from Cafayate (based on Malbec) is pretty tasty, balanced and interesting. The nose is succulent and not offputting, while the palate shows fresh red apple, cherry and length to the finish. Not complicated but racy and clean.","46426":"Earthy and seemingly on the edge of being overripe, this is a wine that deals dark-fruit flavors, a milky, malty underlay, and a fairly sound mouthfeel. Ample tannins and resiny, peppery afternotes re-announce any previously detected oak, and like many wines from this vintage it's overly expressive.","46512":"Berry, plum and raw oak are common aromas for a young, high-end Malbec from Mendoza. This has bright acidity to go with extracted berry power, while flavors of jammy black fruits, baking spices and chocolate offer intricacies like nutmeg and anise on the finish. Drink through 2019.","46521":"Cherry and berry aromas open this slick feeling Malbec. Sweet berry flavors are ripe, candied and medicinal. A candied flavor carries onto the finish, which darkens a bit at the end.","46532":"Melony aromas and a simple mouthfeel render this an enjoyable Torront\u00e9s. Melon, apricot and lychee flavors all fit the bill, while the palate is round and viscous. Drink now.","46551":"This blend of Malbec, Bonarda, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is oaky and minty up front, with pencil lead and exotic blueberry aromas. In the mouth, this has a fast pulse, while flavors of Middle Eastern spices, cassis and blueberry finish briny but short.","46617":"Beefy black-fruit aromas are inviting for their accents of licorice, coconut and crushed minerals. Feels lush, layered and intense, the perfect framework for lusty blackberry, toast, mineral and espresso flavors. Long, warm and dense on the finish. Drink now through 2016; made from Malbec, Bonarda and Cab Sauvignon.","46629":"A bit of dust and leather for openers, with short black-fruit flavors and a big wave of tannins on the palate. So expect some grab and choppiness. Despite moderate hardness, there's good dark fruit and limited herbal intrusion.","46635":"From Santa Carolina, this Malbec is what you'd call meaty but a little raisiny. It shows signs of mild reduction, which pushes the flavors to marmalade. Pepper and a little coffee-like bitterness on the finish close the show. Drink now. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.","46682":"Dusty orange and nectarine aromas are nice but highly regular. This feels round, easy and melony, while flavors of honeydew and pear are mellow and finish soft. It's friendly and quaffable.","46685":"Gritty, muddled dark-fruit aromas come with burnt overtones. This has a hard, grinding palate along with roasted blackberry and raisin flavors. A minty character and hard tannins drive the finish.","46694":"Aromas of cedar, juniper, graphite and blackberry are woody and full but fail to announce fairly the choppy astringency the palate brings. Herbal blueberry, pie cherry and mint flavors end with tangy, tart, borderline sourness on the finish.","46698":"Dense, lush aromas of coffee, blackberry and turned earth give way to notes aged Gouda cheese. The jammy palate is packed with a mix of blackberry, plum and cassis flavors that blend together. A compact, grapy finish shows no hard edges, gaps or breaks. Drink through 2022.","46700":"Hedonistic berry, raisin and fig flavors are complete. While this is tight and tough on the palate, it's solid as a boulder in terms of structure and balance. A ripe mix of black-fruit and mocha flavors finishes with all the power one could ask for. Drink this Bordeaux blend through 2027.","46720":"Dusty berry and plum aromas are inviting and come with notes of vanilla and coconut. This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc is flush while displaying a firm grip. Flavors of vanilla, mocha, black cherry and blackberry finish deep and with a lasting hint of fig. Drink through 2024.","46745":"This is a rich, plush Cabernet, with a sense of elegance. It smells like prune, blackberry, coffee and toast. The concentrated palate boasts prune, olive, coffee and dark berry flavors. Drink or hold for a few years.","46919":"Heady smoky aromas of blackberry, prune, licorice and fine oak announce a tannic, deep and firmly built palate. Spicy, toasty oak notes blend with ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, while an oaky peppery toasted finish is potent and bodes well for the future; drink this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon combo from 2018\u20132026.","46948":"Ripe loamy black-fruit aromas are attractive on their own and benefit from an elegant note of balsam wood. Energetic and balanced in feel, this Malbec tastes of savory meaty black fruits. A toasty lightly oaked finish offers a shot of chocolate and a milder hit of coconut. Drink through 2020.","46949":"Tarry blackberry aromas are piercing and a bit gritty. This feels ripe, plush and balanced, with blackberry, spice and herbal flavors. A moderate note of heat rises to the surface of a finish with herbal blackberry flavors.","47031":"Smooth berry and chocolate aromas control the nose on this Cabernet-Syrah blend. On the palate, it's lush and full, with a streak of citrusy acidity. Flavors of plum and berry come with chocolate and vanilla accents. Regular on the finish in terms of length, power and complexity.","47151":"Woody, savory, rich aromas of black fruits introduce a rich, creamy, modern palate with lush blackberry, chocolate and vanilla flavors. As a whole, this Malbec is dense, deep and round, with warmth and an overriding baked character. Drink through 2019.","47153":"Smoky, concentrated aromas of blackberry, cassis, charred oak and herbs are complex. This has a tannic, grabby, stretched mouthfeel and herbal, oaky flavors of blackberry and boysenberry. Grabby tannins resurface on the finish, which is woody, long and spicy. Drink through 2022.","47157":"Concentrated aromas of blackberry, licorice root and Graham cracker are lusty. This feels thick on its edges but somewhat sharp and tartaric in the middle. Flavors of molasses, raisin, cassis and blackberry are bolstered by sharp acidity, leaving a finish that hits fast then falls off. Drink through 2019.","47285":"Tight wild berry and cherry aromas come with a soapy accent. This is blocky and fiercely tannic, with muscular, grapy flavors that hint at blackberry before turning hot and bitter on the finish.","47287":"Dry, briary, leathery aromas come in front of a high-acid palate that's almost shocking in its zestiness. Tart but generic flavors of cherry and red plum finish with a skins-like texture and lasting acidity.","47289":"Standard berry aromas come with sharp, warm notes. A punchy, angular, high-acid palate delivers potent red-fruit flavors along with an active, fiery finish.","47352":"Saucy aromas of red plum and tomato are fresh but not overly ripe or fruity. This is also fresh on the palate, but somewhat lean. Slightly salty berry flavors are mildly spicy, while this maintains a theme of freshness and modest fruit on the finish.","47369":"Aromas of baked berry fruits, rubber band and forced oak struggle to be taken seriously. A grabby drawing palate offers stewed berry flavors in front of a finish that's pushed by rubbery tannins.","47398":"With an opaque color and huge aromas of graphite, blackberry, cassis and creamy oak, this epitomizes modern Argentinean wine. The palate on this Malbec-and-Cabernet-Franc-driven blend is weighty, relaxed and deep. Flavors of baked blackberry, cassis and plum come with herb, chocolate and spice accents. Look for additional oak and chocolate on the chewy but smooth finish. Drink through 2018.","47400":"With huge amounts of graphite, toast, wood grain, blueberry and blackberry aromas, this Cabernet Franc-led blend (with Malbec and Petit Verdot) is solid as granite, with a layered structure. Flavors of blackberry, chocolate and herbs dance together, while the finish is long, dark, minty and chocolaty. Best from 2016 through 2022.","47544":"Tapiz's best wine to date, and the first one to shoot higher than the basic or reserve level. Aromas of fresh balsam wood, ripe blackberry and cola are clean and deep. Feels just right, with rich, rewarding flavors of molten berry, chocolate and coffee. Finishes warm, toasty and with focus. Has it all; drink now through 2015.","47640":"This is mild and lightly oaked on the front end, with peach and apple notes. It feels narrow and focused, with honeyed apple, pear and melon flavors that aren't too sweet or candied. Light and simple feeling on the finish, with elegance.","47671":"Cool, breezy Patagonia is the home address for this light-colored but full-flavored Cab Franc. Cherry, berry and woodsy aromas set up a firm, wide palate with lightly herbal, leafy flavors of berry fruits and chocolate. Cocoa dust and a pinch of saltiness are noted on a full finish. Drink through 2022.","47846":"While showing roasted, tomato-like aromas, this Malbec from northern Argentina also features a nose full of tobacco, earth and berry fruit. There's acidic snap to the palate, but that only pumps up raspberry, toast and mild herbal flavors. A spicy, woody finish tastes exotic and saucy.","47889":"This is a jammy, dense and pure Cabernet, with meat and berry aromas that mix in touches of graphite and chocolate. It feels a little hard and acidic despite its size, while the flavor profile is of mossy berry fruit and chocolate. Tight and nervy, this offers lots of acidic push on the finish.","47964":"A well-made Malbec that should please almost any fan of red wine. The nose is concentrated and full of black fruit, so it delivers what you'd expect. The mouthfeel is balanced, with medium weight and easy tannins. Black-fruit tastes of all types make for a solid flavor profile, and the finish offers mocha and cleansing acidity. A rock-solid wine for beef and pastas.","48007":"Plum and berry aromas are infiltrated by touches of leafy green and leather on the nose of this texturally sound, herbal-tasting Malbec. Flavors of plum and spice are a touch weedy, while baking spice and clove notes take over on the finish.","48179":"Aromas of tar and rubber give way to rich black fruits and toasty oak. A hard, tannic palate means this needs air or meaty foods. Oaky, resiny berry and cassis flavors finish chocolaty, with intense tannins. Drink through 2021.","48253":"This Malbec-led blend (with Petit Verdot and Tannat) is muscular and piercing on the nose, with aromas of brick dust, black cherry, cassis and raisin. The palate is saturated and creamy, with a lactic sensation competing with rubbery tannins. Flavors of vanilla, raw oak, tomato, plum, herbs and chocolate are complex and finish with multiple interest points along with mild heat. Give this more time, if possible. Best from 2018 through 2022.","48259":"This Bordeaux-style blend screams out friendly, from its warm, earthy bouquet of marzipan, earth and black fruits to its flush, layered palate to flavors of plum, berry, chocolate and fig. Finishing notes of licorice, spice and chocolate are plump and generous. Drink through 2019.","48260":"Concentrated blackberry and desert brush aromas are dense and intense. While this is very rich, it's not overbearing or out of whack. Blackberry flavors with savory spice and earth notes end toasty but not overly complex. Drink through 2019.","48381":"Smells less like fruit and more like a combo of rubber, cement and tin. The mouthfeel is hard and the flavors are rubbery and chemical, with some oaky red fruit rising to the top. Hard tannins don't help.","48390":"An oaky wine that's funky at all checkpoints. The nose is briney and cheesy, while the palate is astringent and offers a speck of orange but mostly just resiny oak. And it's barrel city on the finish.","48483":"Dark in color, this chunky, ripe Malbec opens with blackberry, earth and rubber aromas. That bold, full quality carries onto the palate, which is staunch and bullish, with pepper and berry flavors that finish dry, yet weighty and lush.","48504":"Like many wines from this vintage, Melipal seems afflicted with 2005 blues. It has black plum and some woody char to chew on, but also saline and frisky tartness. Gets better with airing and will show best with food, but it's clearly a step down from prior years.","48514":"Yellowish to tan in color, this young wine is already showing signs of age, but get it early and you'll find creamy but sturdy flavors of squash, kumquat and peach. There's oak in support and plenty of personality. Whether that personality is universally appealing, however, is doubtful.","48602":"Pencil eraser, plastic and vanilla are all reflective of the oak thrown at this blend of Malbec, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. In the mouth, this is heavy, grabby and hard, while blackened flavors of oak and baked fruits set up a finish with creamy oak, herbal accents and heat.","48608":"High-toned, raw aromas of cherry and currant are backed by toasty oak and mint. Lively and lifted as well as choppy in feel, this tastes mostly of char, plum and peppery spice. Things blacken up on a hot, firm, toasty finish.","48647":"Tropical aromas revolve around lemon-lime. This is acidic without much body. Flavors of lemon, melon, mango and green apple are lean and finish with tangy, pithy citrus flavors.","48655":"Funky smelling, with a mix of sweat, hot summer field and leather. It's more fresh in the mouth, with adequate acidity and stalky, slightly minty flavors mixed with mild berry notes.","48689":"A deep, developed wine with cola, licorice and prune aromas. The palate is poised and balanced even if it's rich and very ripe. Layered in the mouth, with plum, prune, chocolate, coffee and fine spice, which is about as complete a package as you'll find with Malbec. Cabernet and Syrah; drink now through 2015.","48711":"Rubbery, dense aromas are murky and on the green side as leafy, tomato notes rise up. Feels a bit thick and heavy, with herbal, sticky, sweet berry flavors mixed with a syrupy grab. Carries its weight in plodding fashion; a sweet and unctuous Cab.","48723":"Stalky aromas suggest hay and green herbs, with raspberry in the backdrop. It's hot and short in terms of mouthfeel, with herbal flavors leading the way and berry fruit running behind. Dry red fruit and herbal notes dominate the finish.","48724":"Starts out volatile, with a burning sensation to the nose. After settling, the palate shows heat along with baked apple, melon and bitterness. Finishes solid but pithy, with some leftover heat.","48725":"Opens with jammy aromas but it's also stewed and stalky. The palate is resiny and tannic, which means it's grabby. Tastes a bit leafy and burnt, with spiced, roasted red plum flavors. Offers mostly oak spice and heat on the finish.","48855":"Spicy red-berry aromas with an accent of musky, cheesy oak get this Malbec-Bonarda blend moving in an interesting way. A tight, pointy palate with lean acidity houses flavors of plum and berry along with creamy oak and vanilla. Lactic oak is a factor on an otherwise bright and spicy finish.","48857":"Dark berry aromas are smoky and stout, and overall this well-oaked Malbec gives off a sense of seriousness on the nose. In the mouth, there's tension but also balance. Flavors of blackberry and cassis are oaky but expressive. It's spicy, a touch resiny and lasting on the finish. Drink through 2019.","48869":"Waxy, dusty apple and oak aromas reflect the 30% S\u00e9millon, but this is mostly Chardonnay in quantity, style, feel and flavors. Salty melon, tropical notes and nicely laid-out oak flavors turn a touch bitter on a weighty but healthy finish. Drink this classy white blend through 2018.","49018":"Ripe blackberry and cola aromas comes across as foresty and nice as a whole. This saturated, dense Malbec shows brutish, choppy tannins along with flavors of blackberry, exotic spices and fig. The finish remains rough and turns hot. Drink through 2021.","49103":"Jammy aromas suggest a mix of sugar beet, reedy red fruits and Graham cracker. The palate on this first-ever Cabernet from Punto Final is big and blocky, with oaky, herbal flavors of spiced berries. A lively, semisweet finish has a molasses hint and mild green accents.","49116":"With 10% each of Viognier and Chardonnay added in, this Torront\u00e9s is tropical and citrusy on the nose, then tangy and juicy on the palate. Flavors of orange and other citrus fruits come with plenty of life and acidic kick. As a whole this is fresh and a tad sweet on the finish.","49265":"Lychee and tropical fruit aromas are heavy and rubbery. Ditto the palate, which weighs in soft. Generic tropical flavors of lychee and papaya are mellow at best and finish with bitterness.","49274":"This herbal wine has grassy plum aromas and a touch of cowhide on the nose. Aggressive tannins and sharp acidity run alongside leafy plum and raspberry flavors. Chocolaty oak with vanilla sweetness helps things along.","49276":"There's matchstick to the nose along with aromas of lychee and tropical fruits. This is a bit heavy and creamy on the tongue, with sweet, lightly grassy flavors of melon and citrus.","49376":"Aromas of asphalt and grilled steak accent berry and cassis scents. This hits hard on the palate, with no mercy to the tannins. Flavors of cherry and cassis come with notes of desert sage and chocolate. Drilling tannins last through the finish. Drink through 2020.","49652":"Off the grid and strange smelling, with jumbled aromas that are hard to describe. Exceedingly sour and lean on the palate, with a vegetal finish.","49754":"Year by year, Salentein's top wines are improving. Primum is truly a fine wine, right up there with the country's best. It's harmonious and inviting, with cola, mineral, floral notes and honest black fruit aromas and flavors. The feel is secure and tight but also well balanced, with a touch of molasses but mostly just deep, driving black fruit. Muscular, intense and long on the finish. Drink now.","49760":"Rock solid, clean and composed. For the past several years this Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet blend has been an Argentine flag-bearer, and the '05 is as good as past vintages. Look for bold berry flavors accented by medicinal, herbal notes. And then comes a finish that's chewy and round. This is like a fat fastball in the proverbial wheel house; just see it and swing away.","49781":"Focused berry aromas are cool and smell slightly rubbery. A medium-bodied, good-quality palate features generic but pleasant plum and berry flavors, while the finish holds steady, with a dash of spice and complexity.","49792":"Evident aromas of prune and raisin announce extreme ripeness. Like the nose, this feels ripe and chunky, with hard tannins. Jammy, extracted flavors of raisin and black plum are oaky and peppery prior to a pushy finish with heat.","49911":"A little damp and earthy at first, but it rounds into a full, powerful Malbec with a lot of color, size and drive. Blackberry, chocolate and spice notes control the hefty palate, and coffee precedes a bitter dryness on the finish. An improvement over the past couple of vintages. Drink now through 2012.","49918":"A different style of Mendoza Malbec (with 30% Merlot), and for the most part it's intriguing and satisfying. For starters, the bouquet is a true bouquet: there's funky spice, cinnamon stick and floral fruit aromas. The palate has some snap and acidic sharpness, but also good blackberry essence. Finishes smoother than up front, with woodspice and pepper coming on strong. Drink now through 2010.","49934":"Sophisticated barrel aromas of butterscotch, dusty peach and apple cider are inviting, while the palate shows good intensity along with flavors of apple, pineapple, peach and vanilla. While this is toasty, well-oaked and modern in style, it avoids being heavy and flat. Still, drink now for optimum balance.","50009":"Aromas of balsam wood, dry spice, berries and vanilla are attractive and inviting. It feels lush and deep, with good layering and robust flavors of berry fruit, spice, herb and tobacco. Flush and slightly herbal tasting on the back end, this is a complex, quality blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah.","50019":"Norton Reserva is one of Argentina's best Cabernetss for the money. This vintage offers a mineral aroma along with rose petal, baked plum and spiced cherry scents. It feels deep, generous and balanced, with cassis, blackberry, earth and molasses flavors.","50025":"Nectarine, peach pit and a dusty, oily scent define the nose on this mid-level, quaffable white. The body is on the plump side, with ample acidity. Flavors of stone fruits and papaya finish briny.","50043":"Latex, leather and asphalt aromas compete with berry aromas on what amounts to a hard, tough nose. Narrow in the mouth, with tomato-like acidity, this tastes woody and salty, with modest berry flavors.","50208":"Sweet apple aromas are probably the most defined thing coming off the innocuous nose, while the palate is forceful and citrusy, with jangly pineapple, peach and lemon flavors. Amplified white wine with a vague Viognier identity.","50217":"Fairly citrusy and lean for a reserve-level Malbec. The nose is short, high-toned and shows aromas of red fruits, citrus and even celery. The palate is fresh but tight and drying, with raspberry flavors and cherry skins and tomato on the finish. A red-dominant wine.","50265":"Oily, gritty stone-fruit aromas announce a plump, soft palate with papaya and banana flavors. A mealy quality and bitterness rise up on the finish.","50327":"The nose conjures feral notes of skunk. A rich, syrupy palate tastes complicated and uneasy. Flavors of brown sugar and herbal black cherry are confusing, while the finish is herbal, earthy and green.","50329":"This heavily oaked wine starts closed; only clove and asphalt aromas escape. In the mouth, it's sinewy in feel, with overly demanding wood-based tannins. The flavor profile is all burnt oak and clove, while showing barely any fruit.","50331":"Gritty, burnt, stalky aromas are shy on fruit and not that fresh. This is tight and rough in feel, with peppery, herbal flavors that run green and low on fruit. More oak and modest berry flavors carry the finish.","50343":"This starts out massive and grapy, but with each passing minute it becomes more Salta, and hence more complex. Feral, leathery, roasted-berry aromas require patience. In the mouth, this is tannic and muscular, with herbal, spicy, dry flavors of blackberry and stewed plum. Raging acidity and firm tannins suggest that this needs at least until 2016 to settle.","50403":"Reedy and minty in smell, this has a green aroma that shares the stage with cassis and plum notes. It feels gritty and choppy, with rustic flavors of burnt leaf, roasted berry and herb. The finish is short on flavor and high on heat.","50428":"This friendly wine offers fresh, jammy berry and cherry aromas. The palate has a bit of grit and stickiness to it, while blackberry, black cherry and boysenberry flavors are ripe, sweet, not pushy and ultimately satisfying.","50448":"Herbal, tomatoey red-berry aromas lead to a fleshy, fresh palate with barely any structure. Plum, currant and herbal flavors finish solid, with basic flavors of oak and spice.","50463":"Grapy aromas of black cherry introduce a tight, rubbery but fair palate. Ripe berry, black cherry and bitter chocolate flavors finish with a note of toasty oak but also fiery burn. Let this aggressive Malbec air out and it will show best.","50496":"Dark and fiery, with grapy, heavily extracted aromas. Compared to the winery's Premium Cabernet, this is harder and more choppy, with staggering tannins and heat on the finish. It's a monster with teeth, and only time will tell if it finds a friendlier place. Hold for a couple of years.","50545":"Exotic aromas of cardamom, blueberry and spiced currant filter onto a fresh but wide-bodied palate with raspberry, blueberry, herb and spice flavors. The finish is intriguing due to a reprise of notes like anise, mint and herbal berry flavors.","50585":"Obra Prima is a perennially excellent wine that satisfies more than it overwhelms. This vintage is woody on the nose, with blackberry, moss and an herbal. The mouthfeel is deep and plump but not soft, while toasty blackberry flavors control the palate and finish with herbal, baked notes.","50609":"After a few nice vintages of Sol Huarpe from this San Juan producer, the 2007 is sharp and weighed down by rhubarb and burnt field aromas. The palate is thin, while the flavors are mildly vegetal and soupy. Finishes crisp and citrusy. Blame it on the vintage.","50614":"Reserved on the nose, with a hint of rhubarb and bramble. But where this wine really fails to impress is on the palate. It's sharp and underdeveloped, with tart cherry aromas and piercing acidity. Some mocha and vanilla come on late to help things along, but by then the wine has defined itself as borderline sour and miserly. Unusually short on fruit for Luigi Bosca, a winery we've come to like. Imported by Multiple U.S. Importers.","50652":"Spicy tomato aromas show an herbal side as well as red plum and cranberry notes. In the mouth, this is ratcheted down and crisp, with fine acidity creating ideal Pinot framework. Flavors of briny plum and currant end more oaky and rich, with a light caramel note to go with lasting dried red-fruit flavors.","50673":"Wild berry, licorice and plum aromas are solid but quiet. This Cabernet is built on leathery, tough tannins and roasted, savory flavors of saucy berry and plum. A spunky, savory tasting finish is tomatoey and leathery, with leftover sauciness. Drink through 2020.","50909":"Cool, grapy black-fruit aromas are front and center on the nose. This feels dense and a touch hard and tannic. Bumpy, chewy blackberry and dark plum flavors are lusty and come with a hint of sawdust and oak prior to a tannic finish that's hard, powerful and can still use some time. Drink through 2020.","51009":"There's no drop-off in this wine from the excellent 2005. Expect blackberry, cassis and dry balsam wood\/cedar aromas. The palate is lush and chewy, but also vital and lively. Toasty, dark berry flavors get a softening of vanilla on the finish. A winner to drink now through 2013.","51010":"Among full-bodied, old-vines Malbec, this is an unbridled winner. The nose is rooty and sweet, but also inky and dark. And the palate is totally pure, with snappy tannins, fine acidity and loads of black fruit flavor mixed with tobacco and coconut. Racy, juicy and delicious as it enters its prime. Drink now through 2013.","51093":"If you catch this wine soon, meaning before it goes belly up, you may like its peachy simplicity and ample palate weight. Lychee, melon and spiced-meat flavors are interesting up to a point, and the finish is generic, soft and clean. Drink immediately.","51146":"A little stewy on the nose, with vanilla, liqueur and roasted berry aromas. The palate is young and vibrant, arguably teetering on sharp, with piercing cherry flavors and lots of oak. Flavorful but rough, with burnt brown sugar on the finish.","51150":"An unusual blend of Riesling, Albari\u00f1o and Sauvignon Blanc that is largely neutral on the nose and then waxy, honeyed and pithy in the mouth. Along the way there's an appealing dry, melony, petrol character and some good old-fashioned tang. A breed unto itself.","51209":"This extracted purple Malbec is furry and grapy smelling. A heavy sticky palate feels creamy, while cherry and boysenberry flavors are so ripe that the word syrupy is in play. A note of chocolate and lasting creaminess come up on the finish.","51224":"Brambly and wild on the nose, this Cafayate Malbec features a narrow palate with edgy, briary plum and berry flavors. This seems riper with time in the glass, but all the way through it's pinchy in feel and ultimately ends with candied sweetness.","51263":"A rusty, translucent color announces a light body. Along the way, aromas of compost and leaves, red fruits and earth don't stir much interest. Meanwhile, light oak and stalky red-fruit flavors finish leafy.","51353":"A full wine with smoked meat, licorice and black-fruit jam aromas. The palate is healthy, snappy and tannic, with earthy, full-blast berry flavors that veer toward sweet raisin and syrup but then pull back before falling off the cliff. Saturated, dense and raisiny, but still very rich, real and rewarding.","51367":"Winemaker\/owner Alejandro Vigil keeps the hits coming with this complex but highly appealing blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Robust aromas of balsamic black fruits and licorice ease into a round lush tannic palate. Lightly herbal flavors of blackberry, cassis, pepper and baking spices end with spicy chocolaty oak and licorice flavors. Drink this whopper through 2024.","51524":"Leathery berry aromas are earthy and suggest notes of cured meat and cheese. It gets tougher and more tannic the more it breathes, with black fruit, herb and spice flavors. Generous but rough in feel, it has a powerful, medium-long finish.","51529":"The fresh berry aromas are solid, and the palate is plucky and lively, with plenty of acidity to push the ripe, standard Malbec flavors of blackberry and spice. It shows some tartaric crispness and bite on the finish, but tastes right.","51530":"This smells roasted, leathery and earthy, with a mouthfeel that's solid if a bit scratchy. It delivers an intense wild-berry aroma and some of Cafayate's signature complex herbal character. Oaky vanilla and dill notes accent the finish.","51585":"Like the winery's Gran Reserva '08, this is a saturated bomber that rides along the edge of overripeness. Aromas of baked berry, cassis, vanilla and coconut are rich and oaky. It feels tannic, with a beam of shrill acidity that props up flavors that otherwise might seem raisiny or pruney. Chocolate and wood resin tones pile up on the finish.","51591":"There's plenty of size, sweetness and fruit on the nose. It feels rich and ripe, with an exemplary weight-to-acid ratio, and it tastes juicy, fruity and friendly, with notes of black licorice and dark chocolate on the finish. A wine that properly blends Malbec's sweet and sultry sides.","51614":"The off color of this wine is a hint that it's unusual, and a white from Pinot Noir is indeed not too common. This shows roundness with acidic balance. A pop of melon and peach flavors turns slightly bitter on a fresh yet fairly long finish.","51878":"The curtain rises to smooth, lightly balsamic aromas of blackberry, black cherry and cedar. On the tongue, this Malbec is plush, smooth, chewy and a touch creamy. Elevated berry, mocha and vanilla flavors are oaky but not overdone. The finish is pure, succinct and deep, with lasting black-fruit echoes. Drink through 2019.","51892":"Graphite, lemon peel, cedar and blackberry aromas are lusty and high in quality. A flashy, fresh, slick mouthfeel is the perfect vessel for toasty, dark blackberry, coconut, vanilla and mocha flavors. The mocha note persists on the finish, which is juicy and fresh but also thick and chewy. Drink through 2018.","51898":"This is a potent brew with complexities galore, but there's also a simplicity about it that's appealing. Its raw size is bracing, but the structure and fabric of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon scream balance. Aromas of lead pencil, sawdust, coconut and brandied cherries introduce briary dark-berry flavors. A long, minty, power-packed finish says lay this down for a few years; drink from 2014\u20132020.","52104":"This Malbec-Merlot-Tannat blend from northerly Salta is bright purple in color, with compact aromas of wood smoke, graphite, ink and blackberry. The acidity is high but functions as a brace for plum, blackberry and cassis flavors. A crisp, clampy finish is edgy due to aforementioned racy acidity. Drink through 2020.","52120":"Lime and mango aromas stick out on an otherwise neutral, crisp bouquet. This is lean and well cut, with refreshing citric acidity. Flavors of pineapple, lime and green apple finish with zest and continuity. Drink now.","52140":"A big, intense Malbec with giant black fruit aromas that veer toward medicinal. The palate is sizable and sticky, with grabby tannins bulking up sweet, ripe blackberry flavors. Finishes with mocha and creamy vanilla flavors. Chewy, broad and on the money.","52153":"Opaque and thick, with all types of black fruit aromas blending with smoked meat scents and toasty darkness. The body is fleshy and extracted, with raw tannins and a clacky feel. Tastes woody and baked, with blackberry, licorice and sweet plum flavors. Turns herbal and minty on the finish.","52175":"Lemon peel, wet clay, sandalwood and nutmeg aromas are inviting. In the mouth, it's tight and tannic, but lively, with leather and roasted berry flavors. Finishes firm, tight and a bit clipped and choppy. A reflection of 2008's tough conditions.","52300":"The nose includes rubbery whiffs of berry, cherry and leather. On the palate, it feels solid but tomatoey, with zesty red-fruit acidity and flavors of red plum, herb, tobacco and spice. It turns more charred and peppery on the finish.","52319":"Sweet, tropical aromas lead the way, followed by notes of melon and vanilla. It feels fresh, with citrus and lychee flavors. The finish is tropical and green tasting, with nervy acidity.","52320":"Tropical and pure on the nose, this has aromas of lychee, lime, talcum powder and candle wax. It feels juicy and healthy, with flavors of apple, lime and lychee. The finish is steady and pure.","52383":"Blackberry and slightly green, herbal aromas start it off, and while the flavors maintain that herbal, green-tobacco core, there's enough body, blackberry and oaky coffee and mocha notes to make it a nice wine. Needs more clarity of fruit, cleanliness and purity to reach the peak, but still good as is.","52388":"More exotic than many Malbecs, with intriguing aromas of prune, moss and savory berry. The palate has a proper, likeable texture and jammy flavors of black cherry and herbs. Finishes a bit short and hollow, which may be a reflection of tough harvest conditions in 2008.","52402":"There's more good to this rough and rugged varietal than there is bad. It's hugely fruity, perfectly ripe, colorful and full of cola, coffee, black fruit, rubber and length. It'll definitely last in a cellar, and that can only help soften the punishing tannins and mouthfeel that dominate the current state.","52433":"Gritty, slightly grassy aromas are low on fruit. This is light yet composed on the palate, with mild stone-fruit and melon flavors. Modest acidity and equally modest fruit flavors make for a mild easy finish. Drink immediately.","52475":"Once again, this Malbec-Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend from Norton excels. The nose is a bit grapy and candied, but there's depth and a level of intensity that bodes well for the future. The palate is deep and concentrated, with blackberry, prune, stewed plum, graphite and coffee flavors in front of a mellow, smooth finish.  Drink now through 2016.","52719":"Aromas of wet cement, plastic and berry fruits are derivative of heavy oak. This feels as weighty as the nose, but with creaminess. Roasted black-fruit flavors share the stage with campfire and clove, while oak and clove are the dominant flavors on a forceful, heavy finish.","52726":"Trapiche has never bottled much Sauvignon Blanc, but this one is true to its name: Pure. Easy citrus aromas are mild and clean. This feels medium in body, with a touch of weight. Orange and other dry citrus flavors are steady across the finish.","52736":"The apple and peach aromas are not forced, oaky or heavy. It feels closed up, without much weight, body or texture, and tastes narrow and citrusy, like apple juice. The finish is short and tangy.","52741":"Scratchy red-berry aromas come with a whiff of latex and milk-chocolate-covered cherry. It feels grabby and tannic, with flavors of baked berry, cinnamon and burnt rubber. The finish is warm, with an offsetting sweetness.","52753":"Raspberry is the lead aroma on an otherwise earthy, mossy and aggressive nose. Full bodied and rubbery, this has a blackberry flavor and an overriding baked character. Sweet and unwaivering on the finish.","52754":"Dense and grapy, this feels sharp before becoming oaky and resiny, with flavors of blackberry and peppery spice, and a slight bitter edge. It offers chocolate and creamy-oak flavor on the finish.","52755":"Sweet red-fruit aromas are mild and earthy. This feels rough on its own but will drink well with food. Flavors of plum, berry and chocolate lead to a similar-tasting, medium finish.","53369":"Lively but also narrow on the nose. The feel is very fresh and juicy due to firm, bracing acidity that gives a tangy, lemony character to the wine's dark-fruit core. Snappy, linear and crisp for a wine of magnitude and extraction. Some might say it's sheering and acidic; others might call it ageworthy.","53371":"Round, dense and correct on the nose, with heft and dark fruit aromas. The palate is tight, pure and just the right size, with blackberry, boysenberry and a bit of vanilla and caramel in the background. Smooth on the tail end, with sweet coconut and mocha notes. Friendly and well done for the price.","53376":"Dark as night, with shoe polish, coconut and powerful black-fruit aromas. This is jammy, dense, soft and not for aging, but it does deliver a truck load of toasted coffee, blackberry, molasses and crisped brown sugar. Supersweet, rich and made to drink now.","53377":"Dark, sweet and rooty on the nose, with a warm, soft outlook. The palate is bold and thorough, with ripe berry, plum and chocolate flavors. Per usual, Punto Final is ripe, sweet and big, with a peppery finish and toasty, jammy warmth.","53477":"Altocedro's 2011 stable of high-end Malbecs all carry something in common: heavy, creamy oak that gives the wines severe milk chocolate and vanilla characteristics. This is sticky in feel, with ripe berry fruit, mulchy earth and resiny flavors. Carob, vanilla and cocoa flavors control a syrupy finish.","53488":"Mellow but friendly berry aromas feed into a firm palate with tight red-fruit tannins and then ripe flavors of blackberry and chocolate cake. The finish is toasty, with a chocolate mint-chip note and acidic snap.","53589":"Citrus blossom and leesy vanilla notes open this balanced aromatic white from Argentina's north. Leesy tropcial-fruit flavors focus on lychee and lime. The wine is moderately long on a simple but solid finish.","53592":"Coffee, beef stock, blackberry and graphite aromas require patience to process. A lively, ringing palate is jammy at its essence. Dark, toasty flavors of blackberry and blueberry are mildly green and herbal. It feels rubbery on a tannic finish.","53910":"This Pinot Noir-heavy sparkler opens with aromas of briny citrus and bready yeast. The palate is fresh and low on weight, with a dominating flavor of pink grapefruit. Overall, this is basic but easy to drink.","53927":"Basic white-fruit aromas are a bit dusty and yeasty. This feels plump, soft and creamy, with bitter-leaning green melon and papaya flavors. Notes of onion and grape skins rise up on the finish. This is a mix of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and Viognier.","53979":"A compelling mix of cherry, plum and spicy aromas spell out Cabernet Sauvignon in block letters. This feels full, but also juicy, fresh and agile. Core berry flavors are lightly toasted and chocolaty, with coffee and lingering spice notes aiding a well-comported finish.","53987":"Floral blueberry and plum aromas are not normal for Mendoza Malbec but are instead exotic, with notes of cumin and cardamom. This is punchy on the palate, with crisp, almost sharp acidity. Plum and berry flavors are peppery and racy, then tight as a drum on the finish. Drink this alert Malbec from Tupungato through 2022.","53995":"Dark, heavy and foresty on the nose, with astringent cherry and coffee flavors. Sharp in terms of feel, with plenty of leftover acidity on the finish. Tartaric acid is all over this wine.","53998":"Prickly pickled aromas are offset by candied fruit notes, while the palate is thin and candied, with nectarine and other less-than-berry flavors. An edgy wine that does little for the image of the obscure Bonarda grape.","53999":"Waxy aromas of scented candles and canned pears define the nose. The palate is low on acid and thus tastes soft and remotely of Bartlett pear and peach. Light on the finish; thus it needs to be drunk now.","54021":"Fresh, minerally lime aromas set up a zesty palate with lemon-lime, pineapple and apple flavors. There's nothing complicated about this snappy white, which finishes with some bitterness and lasting acidity.","54025":"Dusty, lightly woody aromas are smooth and easy to like. Peachy in feel, with moderate acidity, this tastes of peach and papaya in front of a melony, ripe finish that's a bit soft, so drink now.","54030":"While this Cab may be a touch soupy and heavy on the nose, aromas of coffee grounds and berry fruits are good. A full, blocky palate features cheek-rubbing tannins, while this tastes of coffee, chocolate and herbal berry fruits. For everyday purposes, this makes the grade.","54072":"Slightly oily, gritty aromas match wits with melon and lychee scents. The palate is propped up by adequate acidity, while flavors of melon, orange and lychee are typical and end sweet and tropical.","54082":"Apple and peach aromas are slightly waxy and show a spot of petrol. This is citrusy but full in body, with flavors of apple, pear, melon and citrus. A plump, basic finish is monotone, but clean and fruity.","54087":"Popcorn and butter are the lead aromas, and they give way to dusty baked apple over time. This wine feels round, but with just enough acidity. Flavors of candy corn, vanilla, spun sugar and ripe stone fruits finish sweet and fleshy.","54143":"Ripe berry aromas are touched up with cola and root-beer notes that make this even nicer. A muscular, deeply structured palate is home to herbal plum and berry flavors along with notes of coffee and dark spices. Tobacco and herbal notes take over on a complex finish. Drink this Cabernet Franc (with 15% Malbec) through 2024.","54195":"Floral berry, olive and spice aromas make for a rustic nose with polish. This wine feels lively and a bit jumpy, with woody plum and berry flavors that are braced and framed by crisp Patagonian acidity. A lightly herbal, salty finish is powerful but steady. Drink through 2020.","54232":"Aromas of citrus and petrol are backed by a juicy palate with tangy acidity and semisharp flavors of peach, tangerine and stone-fruit pits. Fresh, citrusy length and a lingering note of orange are the finish.","54249":"Baked and stewy on the nose, this Malbec-led blend is oaky and gives off a hickory scent. Chewy and rugged in feel, this tastes of roasted, herbal berry fruits, burnt meat and campfire creosote. Forced oak on the finish results in a strong sense of clove.","54305":"Stalky cranberry aromas are incomplete and properly announce a soupy, clumsy palate. Green, weedy red-berry flavors have an accent of carob. Tannic and herbaceous on the finish.","54307":"Raw cherry and plum aromas are resiny and suggest wet cement. This is shearing and so jacked up with tartaric acidity that it's almost intolerable. Sour, citric flavors and a hard, gritty finish amplify this wine's weaknesses.","54350":"Whether it's this single-vineyard Malbec or its partners below (Turcos or Tanos), the characteristics of each are nearly identical: creamy oak, tons of vanilla and milk chocolate, resiny mouthfeels and rich, sweet berry flavors. Pick one or pick them all; they are quasi interchangeable and only time will tell if they show individuality or remain identical triplets.","54454":"Berry and plum aromas come with notes of woodsmoke and rubber. A fresh but common mouthfeel is pleasant, while red-berry flavors lead the palate and come with a touch of creamy oak. Hence, vanilla and additional cream flavors are key components of the finish.","54466":"Powdery, tropical-fruit aromas are fine but innocuous. This feels clean and good, with ample acidity to keep things afloat. Flavors of tropical fruits come quickly and shutter down just as fast in front of a finish that's slightly oily in feel.","54468":"Earthy berry and cassis aromas are more generic than particular. The mouthfeel on this Cab is scratchy and heavy, with firm tannins that grab and bite. Plum and cassis flavors are minty, herbal and spicy, while the finish is even more minty, with scouring, hard tannins.","54471":"This full-bodied Malbec smells roasted, rubbery and leathery, with meaty berry notes popping in and out. The palate is blocky and thick in feel, while flavors trend toward stalky and roasted, with a green note accenting a chocolaty finish.","54473":"Compact dark-fruit aromas turn more jammy with airing. This is gripping in feel, with firm tannins. Flavors of spice, herbs and  black fruits finish with pronounced acidity, leftover tannins and a leathery accent.","54474":"While this is stout and dark up front, the nose comes with a note of stewed fruit. The thick, tannic palate is grabby and resiny in feel, while flavors of raw oak taste lactic, and the berry fruit component in the wine is loamy and feels big and blocky.","54562":"Solid raspberry, plum and cassis aromas come with a sprinkling of herbal green. The palate features a round feel and good texture, while flavors of cassis and baked plum end in a soft, chunky finish with modest depth.","54602":"Pungent with true Sauvignon character. Tangerine, green fruits and grapefruit share the flavor profile, and the finish is mild but clean. Zesty, straightforward and tasty if served chilled.","54603":"Light berry aromas and a hint of spice open up this generic but solidly made Malbec-Merlot blend. Strawberry and raspberry are the lead flavors, with pepper on the finish. Not very evolved or complex, but good enough.","54612":"Supposedly Do\u00f1a Paula's top selection for 2005, and while the wine shows some earthy darkness and plenty of fruit on the bouquet it doesn't follow up with the mouthfeel or overall balance that it should. It's ripe for sure, but also aggressive, with a disjointed acid-to-tannin ratio and an almost syrupy mouthfeel.","54618":"Heady plum and dark berry aromas give a warning of size and ripeness, and indeed there's a ton of ripe fruit to the palate; but the wine is also raw, untamed and lacking in mouthfeel. It could stand to flow and finish better than it does.","54704":"Patagonian style floral and mild citrus aromas infiltrate the bouquet, with generic red-fruit scents coming on later. Bright, juicy and a little hot and fiery in the mouth, with wild berry flavors and a toasty, dark finish. Plenty ripe but not subtle.","54795":"This defines elegance with respect to South American Pinot Noir. A fine blend of cherry, leather and tea aromas leads to a round yet crisp body with toasty, smoky oak framing juicy, light-framed red-fruit flavors. A fresh and precise finish holds onto the wine's generous but refined oak component.","54941":"A rich yellow color and intensely woody aromas of sawmill smoke and barrel spice lead to a fleshy, full and oily palate. This wine tastes heavily of oak and related resin. The fruit character is not a big factor on either the palate or the finish.","54943":"Aromas of forest floor, cassis and blackberry are solid, smooth and inviting. In the mouth, this wine shows penetrating acidity and controlled sharpness. Flavors of cherry, plum and mixed berries are propelled by acidity, and that's also how this ends.","54946":"This is 80% Malbec along with Cabernet Sauvignon. Ripe, malty aromas are almost soupy. The palate is drawing and barrel heavy, while oaky flavors of graphite shadow baked blackberry fruit. On the finish, chocolate flavors are derivative of oak.","55038":"Bold aromas of cola, forest floor and minty blackberry lead to a muscle-bound palate that's more ripe and saturated than outright hard. Oaky, chocolaty berry flavors are dense, while oak-based flavors of maple and woodspice take over on the finish.","55110":"Spicy red-plum aromas are dry and gritty, but fresh. This firm feeling Cab holds its own on the palate, which is tannic and a bit sandpapery. Tight, juicy flavors of spicy plum finish long, dry and mildly salty tasting.","55146":"This smells a bit stalky and murky, without much pop or freshness to the nose. A medium-bodied palate feels about right, while this tastes earthy, stalky and like roasted plum. Herbal notes come up on the finish.","55193":"An extracted, full-bodied style of Malbec with blackberry aromas, density, meatiness and heft. It's thick and a bit awkward, especially early on, and then a roasted berry quality takes over. Solid as a rock, somewhat floral and young, with good kick at the end.","55200":"Starts with bulky fruit and bacon aromas. The palate is sort of rattled and jagged in terms of feel, while the flavors of baked berry fruit slip toward herbal. All in all, it's a pleasant, jammy, friendly, easy-to-drink, generic Cabernet.","55322":"With melon and green apple aromas, this mellow, mostly sweet wine cuts the mustard. The palate has a good feel, while core flavors of mango, melon and lime set up a short, unassuming, no-issues finish.","55354":"This smells big but flat, with rich, jammy scents of berry and cherry. The palate comes across heavy and grabby. Flavors of pastry, lactic plum, berry and cassis are heavily influenced with oak, while the finish is full in feel but short in flavor. A blend of 62% Malbec, 26% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Syrah.","55356":"Cherry, cassis and spice aromas are mild and comported. The wine feels chewy and just dense enough, with baked cassis, berry and herb flavors that finish toasty and hot, with a rubbery note. Clean aromas and full fruit flavors are this wine's best attributes.","55367":"This big-boned Malbec from northern Argentina is full of brawny black-fruit aromas accented by pencil eraser, herbal scents and leafy notes. The mouthfeel is scratchy on the surface and chewy at its base, while flavors of clove, spice, herbs and baked black fruits are harmonious and impressive.","55382":"Opaque in color, this saturated Malbec-led blend exhibits coconut and cola aromas along with fully ripe blackberry notes. This is massive in the mouth, with a solid foundation. Maximum berry expression and a jammy, deep-fruited finish give this power and content beyond its price point.","55385":"This is one exotic number. The nose shows blueberry, boysenberry, charcoal, plenty of oak and hints of cardamom and star anise. A lush, layered palate is intense but doesn't hit too hard, while concentrated blackberry, licorice and spice flavors set up a peppery, minty finish that's stout and structured.","55404":"Dark-berry fruits, tomato and herbs make for a bouquet with ample power and varietal correctness. Big, blocky and fiercely tannic, this Cabernet tastes of roasted black fruits. A finish with heat, spice, oak-based clove and mint notes confirms a high level of oak that for the most part this can handle.","55429":"This full and ripe Cabernet has berry and black cherry aromas. Tannic, narrow and tough on the tongue, it is blasting with flavors of blackberry, mint and black coffee. It's fruit flavor is met with plenty of kick and grab. Can age for a year.","55447":"Briny notes of oyster shell blend with spicy barrel notes and core apple aromas on the bouquet of this crisp, pure, minerally Chardonnay. Flavors of apple, quince, orange marmalade and minerals finish sturdy and secure.","55452":"Earthy, field-like aromas include plum and currant. This Malbec shows tough, edgy tannins and toasty black-plum flavors. A bit of heat and burn is detectable on a bold, rugged finish.","55494":"Aromas of bath oil, candle wax and lychee set up a chunky palate with tropical flavors of lychee and melon. This blend of Torront\u00e9s and Chardonnay is round, plump and just acidic enough to hold its own.","55495":"Fleshy peach and melon aromas comme off as chunky and soft. The palate is just as soft as the nose, with melon and banana flavors. A simple finish is friendly but lacks spine, so drink this Chardonnay before it loses steam.","55554":"This mature, yeasty sparkler from Mendoza smells of brioche and baked apple. Flavors of sourdough bread, cider and white mushroom finish bready and soft, so drink now.","55602":"Quintessential Best Buy stuff, with full aromas of meaty berry and leather. Concentrated and dark across the palate, with full-bodied black fruit, black olive and savory flavors. Offers all the color, weight and fruit that a $12 wine should.","55613":"Leathery aromas blend well with concentrated black-fruit scents. In the mouth, this value-priced Malbec offers juicy purity and plenty of spunk. Flavors of black fruits, licorice and chocolate maintain a sense of freshness, while the finish offers residual blackberry and cassis flavors.","55618":"Initially this Malbec smells pinched and of cheesy leather, although with airing the nose shifts to latex and heavy berry aromas. The mouthfeel is chewy and blocky, while flavors of earthy black fruits, herbs and dried spices finish roasted and briny.","55621":"Char, sawdust and black cherry aromas confirm the wine's \u201coak cask\u201d labeling. Full bodied and ripe, it conveys meaty thickness and bold flavors of berry and spiced plum. A toasty, charred finish is lifted by bright acidity and fresh black-fruit flavors. This will go well with just about anything off the grill.","55651":"Black-fruit aromas blend nicely into chocolate, vanilla and savory fig scents on the nose of this Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot blend. A dense, well-structured palate holds savory flavors of plum and baked berry fruits. A complex finish that revolves around mild oak and salty fruit flavors is lasting. Drink through 2023.","55657":"No need to drink this intense, highly structured Malbec-Cabernet blend soon, although you could. Aromas of blackberry, cedar and desert brush are intense but also complex. Flavors of baked plum, cassis and blackberry finish strong and with modest heat as well as coffee and chocolate flavors. Drink through 2026.","55741":"Smoky plum aromas give way to a crisp palate with sheer acidity. Flavors of tomato, plum and cherry are more raw than voluptuous. On the finish, this racy Cab displays enamel-peeling acidity and a can't-miss sense of freshness.","55744":"Mildly abrasive berry and plum aromas are a bit rough and roasted. This feels good but normal for basic Malbec. Spice, mint and light green notes have a mild impact on cherry and plum flavors. It tastes peppery and persistently minty on the finish.","55758":"Woody aromas of clove and spice clash a bit with jammy, stewy berry scents. This wine feels pushy and resiny, with high acidity that makes the palate feel tomatoey. Herbal, oaky plum and tomato flavors finish with a blanket of oak and related clove flavors.","55767":"Basic tropical-fruit aromas settle on pineapple. This unoaked chardonnay is melony on the palate, with ample acidity. Heavy, ripe flavors of peach, melon and pear turn towards mango on the finish.","55768":"Gamy aromas lead to a sinewy, lean palate. This funky Cabernet tastes of creamy oak, plum and green herbs. It finishes a bit weedy, with savory offsets.","55826":"Earthy aromas of raisin and plum are buried under heavy oak. This is 88% Cabernet Sauvignon and 12% Bouchet, and it feels raw, woody and resiny. Barrel-based aromas of vanilla and wood are front, center and dominant, while this remains highly barrel driven on the finish.","55847":"Dark, burnt, crusty aromas lead to a palate with choppy tannins. Spicy, rooty, peppery flavors of red bell pepper, tomato and plum finish spicy, peppery and savory, with a burst of freshening acidity that adds energy and jump.","55919":"This rooty smelling wine delivers herb, cola and cassis aromas in front of a wiry feeling palate that's loaded to the brim with hard-biting tannins. Flavors of mossy, baked berry fruits come with an herbal streak, and the finish is hard due to those grating tannins. For a five-year-old wine to feel this hard is telling.","56014":"Bright, jammy red-berry aromas are gritty and a bit herbal. A fleshy, jammy mouthfeel belies the snappy raspberry and blueberry flavors that follow. A lot of blue-fruit character and herbal notes grace a high-energy, bright finish. Drink through 2023.","56192":"The quality of Casarena's wines range from excellent to not great, with all points in between represented. This Malbec-led blend is heavy and raisiny on the nose, then syrupy in the mouth, with flavors running straight to candied and flat.","56196":"With acrid matchstick aromas and little else, this wine gets off to a rough start and never finds solid footing. The palate is chunky and grabby, while the flavors are burnt and stalky, with bitterness to the finish.","56336":"Full, creamy, lightly toasted aromas give way to a mature, mellow palate that's a bit flaccid. Nutty flavors suggest papaya and melon, while the finish is low on acidity and thus more flat than ideal.","56343":"Choppy plum and berry aromas are mildly raw and herbaceous, but not overly so. Round and standard in feel, this Malbec tastes of creamy, herbal berry fruits that turn slightly green and oaky. Peppery, medicinal, herbal flavors drive the finish.","56365":"A rich and creamy wine with good structure and plenty of fruit. The nose yields berry essence, vanilla and smoky wood notes, while the palate has depth, layering and composed flavors. There's coffee and chocolate on the finish, and the texture and length seem just right. It's oaky for sure, but this vintage of Q can handle it. Drink now through 2012.","56405":"Dry, spicy red-fruit aromas are solid and standard, while the palate is lean but comfortable, with dry, simple cherry flavors accented by a spot of oak-driven vanilla. Good but as regular as they come. Easy to drink.","56406":"Generally this is a nice South American Chardonnay. The nose offers touches of apple, pear, peach and light oak, while the palate has bounce, acidity and tangy apricot, nectarine and apple flavors. Finishes lively but dilute, with citrus and lemon peel flavors. Hits the target.","56434":"A ripe, raisiny nose with a black-fruit essence and mild warmth leads to a tight and tannic palate. Toasty blackberry and cassis flavors are powerful and include a note of oaky graphite. A dark, spicy finish with full-blast intensity ends the ride. Drink through 2022.","56451":"Having tasted the 2002 through the 2005, the '04 seems bright by comparison, with aromatics that include forest floor, tar and lively berries. The palate, like all the Poesia wines, is mouthfilling and substantial; flavors of black cherry, boysenberry and mocha are knit together and don't skip a beat.","56470":"This wine is much better than most in its class. The blackberry, graham cracker and exotic spice notes are particular to Bosca, while additional notes of bacon, chocolate and nutmeg add to the pleasure. For anyone looking for quintessential Argentine Malbec at a good price, we say start here.","56600":"Ripe aromas of black plum, blueberry and charcoal lead to a palate that's muscular and full-bodied. Dark, peppery, slightly bitter flavors of toasted blackberry and prune end with burnt notes and black pepper along with grabby, rubbery tannins.","56797":"Savory and full, with dusty black fruit aromas, saucy spice and kick. The palate shows good feel and depth, and the flavors of savory berry, bacon fat and vanilla work well together. Mild herb and leaf notes give complexity to the finish, which is long and fades away comfortably.","56799":"Potent and black, with inky, minty aromas that suggest asphalt, tobacco and blackberry. The palate is gritty and seriously concentrated, with dark, oak-driven fruit that carries a tight, lemony personality. Licorice, toast and other black-ish notes bring it home. Ripe but can still age for another 5+ years.","56801":"Sweet and open on the nose, with blackberry and pure grape aromas. The palate has a tight, drawing texture but rewarding flavors of spice and roasted berry fruit. Long and flavorful on the finish, with bite and tannic residue. A wine with positive components but a rough young feel.","56843":"This Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon blend opens with blueberry and currant aromas that hint at the exotic. A flush racy palate is high in acid and a touch abrasive. Plum and currant flavors are not what you'd call cushioned, while this ends with hard edgy tannins and a reprise of scouring acidity. In terms of aging, this will last a long time. Drink through 2027.","56846":"This Cabernet Franc blend opens with herbal oaky aromas of coffee and red fruits. The palate feels tartaric and shocking, with heavy extraction and an overall wiry feel. Jacked-up berry flavors come with more than enough oak, while this is steady but not finessed or elegant on the finish. Drink through 2021.","56942":"Powdery, tropical aromas are light and fresh. And that pretty much describes the wine. In the mouth, it's bouncy, with citrus flavors, tropicality and a hint of nutmeg. The finish is true to the grape, with nice feel and clarity.","56995":"Layered berry and cassis aromas are a bit scratchy and gritty. This Cabernet feels saturated, pure and deep; flavors of blackberry, cassis, prune and chocolate are ripe and generous, while the finish is mildly herbal in flavor, with good length and build. Drink through 2018.","57013":"Clean, straightforward aromas of berry, cassis and mineral are nice, while the palate has ample lushness, purity and focus. Flavors of cola, black currant and blackberry are solid, and the finish keeps its pose. On the money for a regular, journeyman's Malbec.","57018":"Spunky dark fruit aromas open the show, with leather, cheese and mocha coming in later. The palate is a little grabby and acidic, but the juicy flavors of plum, wild berry, citrus and cassis are good. Finishes with some bounce in its step due to full acidity, and overall it maintains freshness and zest. Malbec with smaller doses of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot.","57024":"Cherry, cough drop, mineral, heat and red licorice on the nose, with medicinal raspberry and plum flavors. Snappy and fresh in the mouth, with a rooty finish touched up by vanilla. Flavorful and properly executed, with a slight intrusion of cherry cough medicine.","57028":"Warm, rich aromas of wild berry carry a hint of dried cheese, while the rest of the bouquet is woodsy and spicy. The palate is juicy with fresh acidity, and the flavors of red plum and raspberry are solid. A structured wine with good DNA. Drink now through 2011.","57053":"Supersaturated, so much so that it's opaque, with blackberry, horseradish and chocolate aromas. In the mouth, it's on the cusp of overextraction but manages to toe the line. Flavors of roasted berry, coconut and bitter chocolate are dark and lead to a tannic finish. Drink now through 2014.","57078":"Wiry raspberry and plum aromas put this in the red-fruit category. A loud, tannic, expansive palate blazes with acidity, while fully toasted oak gives this a burnt element to match raspberry and red-plum flavors. Hard tannins and bold acidity make for a long, rugged finish.","57107":"Classy aromas of pear, stone fruits and resiny but controlled oak lead to a pure, moderately woody and balanced palate that delivers ripe apple, melon and peach flavors along with oak backing. Vanilla and walnut flavors grace a nicely textured, creamy yet lively finish.","57274":"Seems slightly mealy on the nose, and then comes a tired set of flavors that includes mushy apple and spice. Finishes easy but dilute, with a pithiness that's normal for the variety. It's the current vintage but it already seems pass\u00e9.","57281":"Smells murky, leafy and of compost. The palate is lean, dry and slightly rough, with green herb, tomato and light raspberry and strawberry flavors. Finishes herbal and tea-like, with more earthiness than clarity.","57285":"Yellow in color, blowsy on the nose, and chunky to the max in the mouth. This wine is big, forced and heavy, with orange, banana and melon flavors. Finishes soft and with no discernible oak or elegance.","57288":"Dark and heavily extracted, with a big, rubbery, gaseous bouquet that foretells the rest of the wine, which is herbal and full-bodied, with baked plum and berry flavors. Finishes oaky, with drying tannins and heat.","57289":"Forward and simple, with red fruit and citrus on the nose. The palate is lean and light bodied, with tangy, dry red fruit flavors, orange and sour sucking candy. Quite tangy on the finish, and overall it achieves only a certain level of weight and prominence. No oak.","57408":"Tomato, red bell pepper, plum and currant aromas have a slightly sharp, varietal-related minty, green angle. This feels round and creamy on the tongue, with good acidity propping up flavors of baked berries, spice, chocolate, raw oak and vanilla. A medium-length finish with baking spice flavors confirms the wine's power.","57495":"Orange peel and lychee aromas are typical of the variety. This feels straightforward, juicy, clean and fresh, with tangy acidity. Flavors of lime, lychee and tangerine finish bright and snappy.","57649":"With robust aromas of cola, coffee, dry leaves and blackberry, this lusty blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc outperforms its reasonable price tag. Despite being big and dark, the palate is juicy in feel. Flavors of cassis and black cherry are backed by chocolate and mocha, while the finish is deep and pure, with toasty notes and additional chocolate. Drink through 2018.","57666":"Cool aromas of kola nut and woodsy black fruit suggest ripeness. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot is linear and jammy in feel, without much depth. Spicy blackberry and grapy flavors are up a notch from simple, while this finishes with toasty oak and spice notes.","57670":"Jammy raisiny berry aromas are soft and a bit flabby. In the mouth, this is dense, jammy and fleshy. Roasted plum and berry flavors carry a salted note, while this holds steady on the finish.","57693":"Wiry, slightly grassy aromas of raspberry and plum come with a touch of oaky vanilla. This Malbec feels downright hard and choppy due to tough gritty tannins. Plum and berry flavors come in blips rather than a harmonious whole, and this tastes of lactic oak and rubber on the finish.","57702":"A bright and lifted three-grape blend with red berry, bright plum and mild oak aromas. The feel is firm but round, with raspberry, plum, pepper and other dry spice flavors. Finishes smooth and uncomplicated, with lingering vanilla flavors. A complete wine made from Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot.","57715":"Yellow tinted, with toasty, creamy aromas of baked apple and pear. Feels round and fleshy but fresh, with peach and baked apple flavors blended with copious toasty oak. Toasty and long on the finish; a high-quality Chardonnay for sure.","57866":"Lightly perfumed tropical-fruit aromas are dusty and a touch soapy. This feels round, oily and cidery, while flavors of orange, nectarine and apricot finish with good weight, texture and length.","57882":"Jammy and mineral-smelling at the same time, this Malbec exhibits an ideal set of plum and berry aromas. The palate is full but juicy, fresh and alert. Raspberry, currant, toast and spice flavors finish elegant and long, with no break-up in the wine's totality. Drink through 2022.","58062":"This Malbec from the Vista Flores zone of the Uco Valley falls outside the box. An exotic bouquet comprised of blueberry, graham cracker, citrus peel and cardamom aromas stirs interest, while a jammy palate deals blueberry, baking spice, Middle Eastern spice and blackened flavors. This is extracted but juicy on the finish. Drink through 2018.","58295":"Standard plum and berry aromas form a harmonious opening. The palate on this Cab is a bit acidic, with a clipped overall mouthfeel and lightly baked, earthy flavors of generic black fruits. The finish is leathery tasting and chewy.","58330":"Berry and cassis aromas are spicy and powerful, with integrated oak in support. This solid, tough wine features rugged but fair tannins. Savory berry, baked notes, leather and herbal flavors are very Cabernet-ish, while the finish is dry, firm and tannic. Age this until 2017\u20132022, or decant if drinking now.","58339":"Saucy, scratchy aromas suggest road tar and compost. This wine is wide in feel, with peppery, spicy raspberry and plum flavors. A minty, herbal tasting finish is neither overbearing nor oaky.","58359":"Tight, snappy aromas of citric red fruit and lemon peel set up a driving, tight palate with brambly berry, spice and herbal flavors. This shows chocolaty oak on the finish and juicy acidity that ensures freshness and long-lasting flavor.","58438":"Floral, alert and nice on the nose, with tight lime, lychee and melon aromas. Feels good, lifted and layered, with lychee, citrus and tarragon flavors. Shows mild bitterness on the finish, but not too much. Nice Torront\u00e9s.","58441":"Ripe and maybe a touch overdone and weighty on the nose. The palate is plump and melony feeling, with sweet pear and vanilla flavors. Creamy, easy and long on what amounts to an oaky finish.","58446":"Dark and sweet smelling, with marzipan, coconut, licorice and black fruit aromas. Surprisingly clacky and tartaric feeling, with oak-slathered berry flavors that are both baked and racy. Shows flashes of quality flavors, but the mouthfeel and overall balance are just o.k.","58496":"Slightly reduced aromas of plum and prune are closed, but there are fine things to come. In the mouth this wine is tight and focused, with ripe tannins. Black-fruit flavors are herbal and spicy, while this takes no prisoners on a long, serious finish. Drink through 2022.","58529":"Jammy blackberry and cassis aromas are weighty and touch up against raisiny. This feels deep and bold: Flavors of cassis, black plum and smoked meat end ripe and long, with racy acidity fueling the afterburners. Drink through 2022.","58679":"Dark, minty and fiery on first take, this folds in aromas of licorice and oaky lemon peel along with spicy berry fruit. Firm and tightly built, this is spicy, peppery and chocolaty on a canvas of berry and cassis. Powerful, toasty and a touch hot on the finish.","58691":"A heavily charred nose puts a burnt crust on top of earthy, savory red-berry aromas. This feels big and blocky. Savory, salty red-fruit flavors live under a heavy oak blanket, while char and burnt-meat flavors linger on the finish.","58698":"A touch creamy and milky on the nose, with shy tropical aromas in support. The palate shows warm-climate melon and peach flavors on a round, chunky frame. A mild, innocuous wine if there ever was one. Drink as soon as possible.","58704":"Compared to the 2004, this wine seems less generous. The nose is solid, with licorice, spice, pepper and plum fruit. But the palate is kind of flat and bland, with plump but dull raspberry and strawberry fruit. For $30 you want more.","58708":"Citrusy but also salinic, with mildly tart and lean lime and orange flavors. There's a touch of canned fruit character to the feel, with grapefruit on the finish. Juicy in the middle but limited.","58713":"Big and black but also heavily charred and very oaky\u2014we're talking bulldozer oak that leaves mostly resin and vanilla on the palate. Combine that with huge tannins and extract, and what should be pleasant and fruity becomes a stampede across the palate.","58719":"Pungent, rudimentary berry aromas come across as candied, while the palate is very narrow and sweet. Drying on the finish due to wayward tannins; doesn't go beyond the ordinary. Imported by USA Wine Imports.","58819":"Jammy raspberry aromas come with herb, oak and lactic notes. This Malbec feels chunky and pulpy, with a sticky oak-resin feel resulting in creamy grab. Flavors of red apple skins, plum, cardamom and vanilla finish sweet and slightly exotic.","58831":"Torront\u00e9s is usually a one-year wine, so this 2011 is showing well via flowery white-fruit aromas and notes of lychee and bath oil. The palate is largely fresh and full, with melon, lychee and tangerine flavors. A touch of wheat flavor and creaminess on the finish are the lone indications of age.","58832":"Cherry and berry aromas are generic but clean and welcoming. A crisp, fresh mouthfeel is fruity and fairly light for Cab, while flavors of red plum, cherry and red apple skins finish racy and not oaky.","58833":"Violet petal, cookie dough and graham cracker aromas surround berry scents on the nose of this good-value Malbec. The palate is jammy and not at all fierce or demanding; flavors of floral raspberry and vanilla finish sweet and a touch candied.","58881":"Floral and clean on the nose, with good red fruit and cherry flavors. By no means is this a fat-styled, extracted Malbec. Instead it's fresh and crisp, but tasty and pretty well balanced, especially if there's some food along for the ride. Imported by USA Wine Imports.","59059":"Initially this smells earthy and rubbery, but with airing it shows roasted dark-berry aromas mixed with horsey leather. The palate is full, tannic and scratchy, with black-fruit flavors, pepper, toast and herbal notes. Toast and coffee flavors are found on a hard, tannic finish. Tasted twice with mixed results.","59061":"This round, sticky blend smells burnt and like underbrush, and is very woody, with milk chocolate and plastic aromas. Thick and sticky on the palate, with lactic oak, sweet spice, carob and berry flavors, this is dominated by creamy oak and generic fruit.","59092":"Balsam wood, pencil eraser, coconut, anise and blackberry aromas share the bouquet. It feels linear and a touch scratchy, with roasted berry and toasted flavors that steer toward bacon. It feels a little gritty and short on the finish.","59171":"Not very vivid in color, with aromas of rhubarb, raspberry and red licorice candy. The palate is a touch scratchy, with flavors of cassis and brown sugar but not a whole lot of true Cabernet character. The finish has a slight tannic bite, but overall this is generic red wine to the max.","59180":"Powerfully oaked but awkward, with bruising aromas of fresh-cut wood, sawdust and campfire smoke. Amid the woodiness and thick body you'll find roasted plum and berry flavors, but on the finish resin reappears and lingers. Tastes too saucy and resiny to be called \u201cclean.\u201d","59345":"Foxy berry aromas are the lead scent, and they're followed by notes of wet dog and raspberry. This is full bodied and round as a ball, with earthy, lightly herbal flavors of red berries, thyme and rosemary. A warm, loamy finish brings oaky flavors and closing weight. Drink this blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon through 2016.","59367":"After opening with graham cracker, plum and ripe berry, the wine settles into a thick and heavy place that's rich but bordering on cloying. This is a heavy style of Malbec that tastes of ripe black fruits and herbs. It's toasty, full, thick as can be and long on the finish. Drinkable now but could use a couple of more years for everything to mesh.","59403":"Brawny, toasty aromas prop up a sturdy oaky nose with a familiar dark-berry core. This Malbec is tightly wound, with wiry acidity. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spiced plum, chocolate and cardamom finish earthy and mellow, with a lingering note of exotic spice. Drink through 2022.","59493":"Horsey plum and pie cherry aromas include a whiff of latex gloves and Band-Aid. This feels rather raw and acidic, with bite. Salty sharp red-fruit flavors finish herbal, with tartaric shear.","59500":"Wiry herbal aromas of blueberry and currant lead to an acidic citrusy palate that's choppy and a bit rough. Quick-hitting plum and currant flavors are herbal before hollowing out on a zesty, tannic finish.","59509":"Low-intensity apple and pear aromas lead to a tight high-acid mouth. Severe flavors of lemon and lime are fairly sour. A long direct finish is linear and shearing.","59511":"Floral berry and plum aromas are also saucy and oaky, and thus discordant. A wobbly tannic palate with green herbal oaky blueberry flavors tastes grassy on the finish. If you know Casarena's wines, this fits the mold.","59514":"Raisiny aromas lack freshness and lift. Following that lead, this Cabernet feels stewy and heavy, with questionable balance. Herbal flavors of stewed plum and tomato finish chunky and choppy.","59786":"Candied black cherry aromas give this a sweet, rich outlook. The palate is bold and heavy, with ripe cassis and other heavy fruit flavors. It's a big, extracted wine that could use more balance and structure. To this taster, it seems denser and duller than past vintages. Frankly it's syrupy and chocolaty on the back palate and finish.","59791":"Clean, pure and lightweight, with aromas of citrus blossom and lychee. The mouth is zesty and crisp, with citrus, lychee and pineapple flavors. Don't expect miracles and it'll work wonders as an ap\u00e9ritif. But drink it soon to capture its white-fruit intensity. Tastes better and fresher than Andeluna's 2006 Torront\u00e9s.","59804":"Nice enough but not all that varietal in terms of aromas, flavors or anything. There's big red and black fruit aromas and flavors along with firm tannins, extract and some pepper. It's rich and chewy, but also tannic and fairly regular. For the price it should not disappoint.","59857":"This waxy, heavily oaked Chardonnay regularly pulls the same score. This vintage has aromas of grapefruit, quince and garlic. Blasting oak and modest acidity result in flatness, while oak resin is by far the dominant flavor, with creamy apple and pithy bitterness lurking.","59925":"Aromas of ripe blackberry, prune and minerality are upright and intense. The palate is lush, smooth and balanced, while blackberry and cassis lead the flavor assault. A deep, long and delicious finish confirms that this wine offes great value for just over $20.","59943":"Light and earthy, with cedar, moss and mild, well-aged red fruit aromas. It's a solid rendition of older-school red wine. Mature, mellow and baked, with roast plum and mocha. Long and earthy on the finish, and drinking at its most mature and best state now.","59945":"Modest lemony aromas set up additional scents of balsam wood, dried cherry, plum and spice. The palate is forward, maybe a touch sharp in terms of acidity, with rustic, roasted, leathery flavors. It is a big wine that finishes lively and also a little rooty and roasted. Cabernet Sauvignon-Malbec-Merlot is the blend.","59960":"Ripe aromas of dark berries blended with licorice and hard spices are attractive. In the mouth, this is round and blocky, with a friendly disposition. Flavors of blackberry, baked plum and black currant finish with licorice, chocolate, oak, mint and pepper notes. Overall, this is a fine Malbec to drink through 2016.","60049":"Blackberry, blueberry and maple aromas announce a rich, ripe wine. There's also toast and char on the nose. In the mouth, this is layered and grabby, with mossy black-fruit flavors that end in a cool, earthy swirl of cola and licorice. This blend of 75% Malbec and 25% Syrah is a stunner and should be consumed now through 2016.","60142":"Smoky, yeasty aromas of burnt orange are spicy and good. This shows a citrusy palate with give and depth along with nectarine, yeast and smoky flavors. Toasty barrel influences are noticeable on the finish, which is moderately sophisticated.","60145":"Black cherry, raspberry, leather and spice aromas are fairly typical of Mendoza Malbec. A fruity, no-nuance palate delivers short but fresh cherry and cassis flavors in front of a jammy finish with rubbery tannins and mild bitterness.","60172":"Expect to see plenty of this Torront\u00e9s across the States (18,000 cases have been imported). But also expect a wine that's lemony and that carries scents of floor polish and air freshener. Being lithe and jumpy is not an issue; the wine is definitely lively. But it doesn't have that ethereal, tropical quality that the best Torrontes' have. It's narrow and limited.","60183":"Lo Tengo, which means \u201cI have it\u201d in Spanish, is Norton's fun and trendy Torront\u00e9s. It's not meant to be serious\u2014it's more of a nightclub or aperitif white\u2014but it does come across as a true but limited Torront\u00e9s. Distinguishing characteristics include melony aromas and tropical fruit flavors. Think basic Albari\u00f1o and you'll have a good clue as to what this is.","60347":"Toasty, smoky black-fruit aromas come with a fair amount of density and char. This is plush but balanced, with blackberry, blueberry and toasty oak flavors. A solid but quick finish isn't complex but it does confirm the wine's quality. The wine is 85% Malbec with the remainder Bonarda, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon.","60359":"Narrow berry aromas are straightforward but not complex. This is a smooth operator with round tannins, plenty of body and a mix of black fruits, licorice, herbs and spices on the flavor profile. Flavors turn more herbal on the finish, where oregano and thyme accent tastes of cassis and berry.","60423":"Subtle on the nose, with coffee, mocha and berry aromas. The palate is built well and stirs up nary a gripe; it's full of cherry and cassis fruit followed by mild espresso-like bitterness on the finish. It's firm almost to the point of narrow, but for many that structure will be appreciated.","60743":"Cherry and plum aromas are aggressive. This energetic Malbec is beyond snappy and juicy, while salty plum and currant flavors are racy and edgy. A briny aftertaste and peppery spice flavors dominate a tough finish.","60763":"Opens with horsey, leathery aromas that are funky and wild, but are surrounded by solid berry-fruit scents. Picks up steam on the palate, which is easygoing, solidly built and just firm enough. Tastes of blackberry, cola, spice and chocolate, then finishes smooth and creamy.","60769":"Clean, pure and uncomplicated on the nose, showing depth and clarity. Smells and tastes much like a good Malbec or Cabernet might; it's sweet and fruity, with black cherry, pastry, baking spices and a certain rubbery quality that seems to come with Bonarda. On the money for this variety.","60828":"Herbal and foresty up front, this Bordeaux blend smells of fig, caramel and berry fruits. Big, tannic and chunky on the palate, this has toasty, chocolaty, burnt flavors and a blackened finish. This offers a lot of power and fruit but it's brusk.","60839":"Berry and plum aromas are spicy and saucy, with secondary notes of tomato and oregano. Snappy on the palate, this live-wire Malbec is a bit aggressive and acidic. Toasty oak and mint flavors accent fresh red-berry fruit prior to an energetic yet woody finish that's raw feeling but fair.","60903":"Packed and concentrated, with blueberry, blackberry, bramble and pastry aromas. Initially, it's jumbled and out of joint, with jumpy acids and heavy flavors of blackberry, grilled meat and herbs, while on the finish, the fruit fades quickly, leaving weight, resin and vanilla.","60906":"Opens with cassis, black cherry, blackberry and dusty aromas that suggest leather. Feels healthy, with blazing acidity propelling dark fruit, toast and vanilla flavors. Juicy on the finish due to semisharp acids, with length and liveliness.","61110":"Zesty, tropical aromas are clean and approachable. This is a patio wine with juicy grapefruit and lime flavors. Lean notes of citrus grace a sharp, pointed finish.","61156":"Black cherry, dark plum and charred rubber give this a masculine opening. Generous and layered across the palate, this tastes of blackberry, chocolaty oak and spice. A lasting, tannic finish is loaded with oak and baking-spice flavors. Drink this ripe, delicious bruiser through 2021.","61157":"This immense Cabernet contains 3% Malbec, and it's about as ripe and raisiny as a wine can get while still holding onto a semblance of balance. Aromas of raisin and baked blackberry blend with rooty cola and vanilla notes. This feels heavy to the point of syrupy, while flavors of prune, mocha and blueberry finish chunky, with low acidity. Drink through 2019.","61165":"Like many Cafayate Cabs, this shows raw, herbal aromas that add rusticity to red-fruit scents. The palate is tight and juicy for the most part, with a touch of oaky creaminess. Flavors of roasted plum and berry fruits come with vanilla, brown sugar and oak accents, while the finish is a bit grating.","61323":"Ripe oaky aromas include prune and raisin scents along with vanilla. This is somewhat rough and heavy in feel, with baked blackberry flavors and roasted meaty notes. A full blast of minty spicy oak controls the finish.","61325":"Flat slightly flabby aromas of green and grassy black fruits smell of sweet plastic and oak. This feels raw, choppy and scraping. Flavors of minty, herbal black fruits are toasty and show grainy, forced oak. Pepper and mint flavors along with scratchy tannins make for a solid but rough finish.","61326":"Exotic citrus and orange blossom aromas are lively and a touch oily. This is racy and fresh, with substance to the mouthfeel. Peachy stone-fruit flavors hint at orange and lychee, while this is lasting and intense on the finish. Drink now.","61358":"Toast, mocha and vanilla aromas lead the charge, followed by a lactic palate with a lot of oak resin and creaminess. As for flavors, this blend deals upfront oak and medicinal berry fruits. A resiny, sticky finish teeters on cloying.","61362":"Scratchy, raw, spicy aromas of saucy fruit and spearmint lead to a palate with minty green, herb and plum flavors. This is herbal tasting on the finish, which is creamy and jammy in feel.","61373":"Resiny, nutty, toasty aromas just barely cut it in terms of drawing you in. The palate on this basic, woody Chardonnay is fine, while resiny white-fruit flavors finish with a forced flavor of vanilla and oak.","61378":"A wall of raw, herbal, minty aromas feeds into a jammy feeling palate. Reduced boysenberry flavors are herbal and green, while the finish is quite green and almost grassy in flavor.","61444":"A lusty value made right. The nose issues black cherry, cough drop and cassis aromas. It's concentrated and balanced, while flavors of black cherry and cassis follow the nose. A mild tannic burn and chocolate on the finish tell you it's good and can go with any meat, from burgers to a quality steak or roast.","61503":"Dry and smoky on one hand, but also somewhat damp and soupy on the nose. This is a medium-to-full PN with a dark color and a mix of sweet and dry flavors as well as chunky oak and chocolate on the back palate. Creamy, sweet and showing a lot of barrel influence.","61511":"Bold, aggressive aromas of shoe polish, grainy oak, campfire and heat lead to a grabby, wide palate with sweet flavors of candied fruit and marshmallow. There's a lot of superficiality here, particular oak, but there's also legitimate Malbec fruit and character that make it worthwhile.","61512":"Pungent aromas of tangerine and passionfruit get it going, so it's not shocking that the palate is zesty and citric, with flavors of passionfruit, lemon and orange. A little dilute in body, with passionfruit as the prime survivor on the finish.","61592":"Initial tar and asphalt aromas yield to grapy berry and earth notes. It feels hard but not real deep, with a short wild-berry flavor that leads to a reasonably good but superficial finish. Juicy and fresh.","61616":"Bold berry, leather and rubbery aromas show a minerally side. This is a big Malbec-driven blend with nice layering and structure. The flavor profile features reduced, roasted black-fruit flavors along with hints of herbs and leaf. The finish is generally smooth and long, with a pinch of heat. Drink through 2017.","61662":"Murky aromas of herbal black fruits and coffee grinds are funky. A scattered mouthfeel and herbal, spotty flavors of plum and currant finish briny. Overall, this is interesting and good but odd, with can't-miss herbal notes.","61728":"Spicy, leathery, gritty notes share the nose with ripe black-fruit scents on this blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Malbec. At this stage, the palate feels narrow and pinched but not miserly. Flavors of spicy blackberry, briary plum and cassis finish with smooth yet strong tannins and a note of licorice. Drink 2015\u20132022.","61749":"Gritty rubbery aromas are low on fruit and suggestive of tire rubber. A choppy palate shows lean peppery spicy plum flavors, while this tastes herbal and slightly tomatoey on the finish, sort of like pizza.","61815":"Gritty aromas suggest burnt popcorn and match stick. This is a round oily style of Torront\u00e9s with briny tropical fruit flavors. A salty note of persimmon carries an O.K. finish.","61824":"Eight years down the line and this Malbec shows the flaws caused by a harvest marred by freezes. This smells like a mix of green bean and jammy boysenberry. The palate feels saturated but soupy, with outsize acidity. Green-herb flavors mix with baked plum and blueberry, while the finish feels sticky, tannic and heavy.","61921":"Aromas of mocha, rubber, smoky leather and berry fruit indicate good things to come, but in the mouth this wine fails to deliver equal to its price and the previous successes of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec project. Scouring acidity is the main culprit; the wine seems clipped, tartaric and angular, thus it's all superficial and not deep or rich enough to rate better.","61928":"Tropical and zesty on the nose, with a big shot of lemon blossom and a secondary note of melon. The palate is juicy, fresh and sort of lean, with lemon, pineapple and green apple flavors. Arguably tart and angular, but at least it's clean and crisp.","61984":"Aromas of brick dust, sweet spice, rubber and leather are good if you're not seeking saturated berry fruit, while the palate is starchy and grabby, with flavors of stewed berry, tomato, leather and earth. Raspberry is detectable on the thin finish, but so is a soupy flavor. Decent wine with some faults.","62174":"Quite intense, with blasting aromas of blackberry, coconut, cocoa and even leather and horse hide. It's 65% Tannat and 35% Malbec, and as a whole it's big, grabby, tight and full of blackberry and raspberry flavors that bring an herbal twist. Smoky and herbal on the finish.","62230":"Leathery plum and berry aromas are foresty but also reedy, spicy and a touch green. This Malbec is full and grabby in feel, with woodsy, spicy flavors that are modest in berry fruit character but definitively spicy, dry and medicinal.","62239":"Stalky, rustic aromas of plum and animal hide lead to a round, solid palate with plum, cherry, herb and spice flavors that are simple as a whole. A lasting but largely fruitless finish is more oaky than anything.","62246":"Stalky, roasted, horsey, baked-fruit aromas are mossy and muddled. Colom\u00e9 always makes funky wines with true Salta character, but this one is soupy, thick and dense in feel, with herbal, savory, salty plum flavors. A dark, chunky, stewy finish concludes this unusual rendition of Malbec.","62250":"This is called Roble, meaning oak, for a reason; the nose is extremely smoky, toasty and gritty, with stalky cherry and cassis scents and a blast of animal hide. A racy, firm palate delivers saucy, stalky, herbal flavors of tomato, red plum and cherry, while the finish feels good and juicy but tastes woody, stalky, herbal and low on ripeness.","62440":"Blackberry, cassis and floral aromas are the lead actors on a musky nose. This ripe Malbec feels thick and syrupy, while rich flavors of blackberry, cassis, chocolate and mocha finish smooth but shy. For such a big wine, this is light on tannic bite. Drink through 2021.","62479":"Brushy aromas of wild herbs along with cherry and plum scents feed into a fresh, fairly full palate. This is generously oaked for basic Malbec, and thus spice and resin notes share the stage with plum and blackberry flavors. A dry, spicy, resiny finish is the close.","62490":"Dark and minty smelling, this bears hints of blackberry, perfume and violet. It feels good and not too forceful, with regular Malbec flavors of dark fruit, red plum and spice. The finish is firm and slightly medicinal.","62589":"Pungent oily, tropical aromas of pineapple and melon come with a distant shot of turpentine and\/or chemical cleanser. In the mouth, this is round and melony, with solid framing. Citrus and lychee flavors finish with a light coating of bitter pith. Drink right away.","62597":"At first, this smells almost entirely of wood and stalky berry fruits; with time, it takes on a cedary quality but remains leathery, minty and rooty. On the palate this is grabby while stalky, briny flavors of herbal fruits end rustic minty and challenging.","62687":"Lime and citrus peel aromas are light and innocuous. Juicy on the palate but light in weight, this tropical-leaning white delivers zesty tangerine and orange flavors in front of a citrusy finish.","62708":"Mild aromas of red fruits are pleasant but somewhat neutral. Flavors of black fruits come with herbal notes, and on the finish, this blend of several grapes has a good feel and solid flavors of minty berry and oak.","62719":"Among Cruzat's line of sparkling wines, this nature-style blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay is the best. Citrus and nectarine aromas are fruity but not nuanced. This is fresh on the palate, with orange and green-herb flavors. The finish is citrusy.","62726":"Mossy, foresty aromas are rugged and settle into blackberry. An intense, pushy palate is woody in feel, with hot, minty, oaky black-fruit flavors that improve with airing. Heat and toasty notes rise up on the finish of this bold Mendoza Malbec, a first from San Pedro (Chile).","62765":"Heavy oak is a major theme on this full-bodied Malbec that's cool and woody to start, with aromas of vanilla and sweet plastic along with ripe blackberry and cassis. Wall-to-wall huge in mouthfeel, this tastes mostly of toasty oak, with blackened, charred berry, mint and peppery flavors in the backdrop. In time look for the oak to settle and the fruit to emerge. Drink through 2021.","62837":"This Syrah smells meaty and roasted, with savory spice aromas and plenty of black fruit on the nose. It's chewy and creamy feeling, with blueberry and blackberry flavors in front of a short finish that's abrupt but clean.","62873":"Smells good, with berry- dominated aromas. The palate is solid but acidic at the core, with sharpness on the palate that creates a juicy, crisp set of raspberry and plum flavors. Flattens out on the finish, where moderate oak-based butter notes rise up.","62881":"Roasted at first, with smoked ham and bacon aromas along with clove and other hard spice notes. The palate is oaky, with chewy tannins and a thick texture; flavors of blackberry are meaty and rich, while clove and more dry spices reappear on the finish. A different breed for Mendoza.","62883":"Much better than prior vintages, when it was known as Finca El Portillo. The nose is jammy and shows black fruit aromas, while the palate is complete and full but juicy, with plum and black cherry flavors. Pepper and toast flavors infiltrate the finish.","62890":"Opens with earthy, leafy aromas that can best be described as \u201cmature.\u201d Throw in tobacco and baked plum, and the picture is complete. The palate is concentrated and tight, with sweet, herbal berry flavors and caramel on the finish. Rugged and herbal as a whole but with good qualities; 50% Cabernet with 40% Merlot and 10% Malbec.","62892":"Blackberry and other sweet aromas lead to a soft, mildly oaky palate with sweet, ripe plum and berry flavors. There's juicy acids and reasonable amounts of toast, licorice and spice on the finish. Not sure what differentiates this from Reserve, but the Barrel Select seems better balanced.","62932":"Concha y Toro's Argentinean branch makes this heavyweight wine, which goes heavy on the oak, toast and horseradish. It's opaque in color, with monster tannins backing plum and blackberry fruit. Finishes hot, peppery and short, but with a lot of texture.","62944":"Perfect color combined with one of the more atypical but interesting bouquets you'll find stirs intrigue. Aromas of mint, berry syrup and most of all clove are intense, while the black licorice and espresso accents on the palate work. Not Spanish in style nor is it reserved. This is a bruising wine with a unique Mendoza identity.","62959":"Baked berry, coffee, molasses and horse hide are the aromas on this tight, rugged Malbec that shows a clipped, choppy mouthfeel in front of lightly herbal berry flavors. This is grabby and firm on the finish, without much cushion. Pour this with grilled meats and it will show best.","62961":"After a gaseous, sulfuric opening, this Cab unfolds nicely. Berry aromas come with leather and a touch of dried cheese, while the palate feels very good, with creamy oak and fine tannins. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, oak and peppery woodspice end in minty fashion. Contains 15% Malbec.","62973":"Dark berry, pencil eraser and spice aromas come together nicely. In the mouth, this is a forward marcher with a good mouthfeel and ample push. Lightly baked flavors of plum and blackberry are fully ripe, while the finish feels sturdy and tastes a bit salty and earthy.","62988":"Big and woody to start, with heavily toasted blackberry and herbal aromas. The palate is thick, dense and tannic, but it doesn't punish. Tastes of cassis, blackberry and herbs before transitioning to dry oak and roasted berry on the finish.","62989":"Lemon peel, wet clay, sandalwood and nutmeg aromas are inviting. In the mouth, it's tight and tannic, but lively, with leather and roasted berry flavors. Finishes firm, tight and a bit clipped and choppy. A reflection of 2008's tough conditions.","62997":"Sweet and easygoing from the start, with candied berry and floral aromas. The palate sits at maximum ripeness, meaning it's sweet and soft but still holds its balance. Flavors of baked berry and brown sugar are generous and smooth, while the finish is mellow and lush.","63011":"Opens with a blast of milk chocolate, raisin and sawdust before settling on black fruit and pepper. Shows good concentration and feel in front of prune, blackberry, licorice and burnt toast flavors. Has good pulse and vibrancy, but it's a bit choppy and oaky.","63036":"Aromas of bath soap and tropical fruits come before a steady but standard palate. Flavors of powdery lime and green melon finish soft and straightforward, without much zing or acidity. Drink immediately.","63234":"Gorgeous balsam wood and graphite aromas blend seamlessly with ripe berry and black coffee scents. It feels lively yet cushioned, tasting like a wicked brew of maple, tobacco, berry pie and fine wood shavings. This is smooth, long and comfortable on the tobacco- and resin-flavored finish. Drink now\u20132018.","63285":"Saucy scents accent core cherry aromas, along with sandalwood and herbal notes. This wine has a lively, pinching palate that is high in acidity. Herbal flavors of tomato sauce and red plum finish long due to racy, raw acidity.","63378":"Raisiny black-fruit aromas are jammy and a clarion indicator of what's to come. In the mouth, this Malbec is saturated and chunky, with extreme ripeness. Flavors of raisin, prune and baked berry fruits come with secondary spice and pepper notes. The finish is earthy, heavy and rich but short on vibrancy.","63395":"In this easy-drinking wine, jammy aromas of multiple black fruits lead to a soft, simple palate with a streak of bracing tartaric acid. Straightforward blackberry flavors come with little to no complexity, while the finish is quick and fades away with modest grip and length.","63614":"Stewy foresty aromas of dark berry fruits are rustic and show a hint of graphite. This is severe on the palate, with hard pinching tannins. Stalky, salty flavors of roasted black plum and blackberry finish similarly, with tannic bite.","63660":"The off color of this wine is a hint that it's unusual, and a white from Pinot Noir is indeed not too common. This shows roundness with acidic balance. A pop of melon and peach flavors turns slightly bitter on a fresh yet fairly long finish.","63684":"Raspberry and plum aromas include notes of brown sugar and warm pavement. A dense, chewy palate is packed with fruit and tannins. Flavors of minty oak and berry fruits dissolve into a heap of tannin and oak on the finish.","63799":"Red-fruit aromas carry a distinct citric edge, while the palate is made up of sweet cassis and cherry flavors along with an incongruent orange essence. The feel is a bit hard and pedestrian, while the finish is quick and ordinary at best.","63800":"Purple in color and smells like sweet fruit, citrus peel and powdered drink mix. Round in the mouth, with generic plum and berry flavors that don't taste all that much like classic Pinot Noir. A simple, bulky wine that's young and probably not going very far.","63802":"Licorice and char on the nose hint at size and ripeness, but the palate does not deliver. Tart raspberry and red-plum flavors are sweet for a fleeting moment and then decidedly sour, while the finish is bland. Shows a few positives but overall it's too snappy and sharp for Malbec.","63807":"Nothing much sublime about Sublimis. The nose is reedy and sweet, with licorice and overripe raisiny aromas. The palate is big and grabby, with clamp-down tannins and hard, crusty raisiny flavors. A bruising red without elegance.","63814":"Rhubarb and vinegar on the nose are ominous signs. The wine maintains a briary, sharp personality in the mouth, where red-fruit flavors have an extra juicy feel. Fresh as a cold winter's morning, but is that really what you want from Malbec?","63818":"Oily and funky on the nose, with a custardy, eggy undercurrent. The palate is oily and dull, while the flavors are of bitter citrus, pith and banana. In two words: not great.","63945":"Offers tropical, stony aromas in front of a crystalline palate that's citrusy as well as peachy, with lychee and melon flavors as well. Finishes springy and bright, with green citrus zest and nothing compromising. 60% Torront\u00e9s and 40% Chardonnay.","63957":"Lime and floral notes create a light and breezy bouquet that's easygoing. In the mouth, it's juicy and fresh, with lemon-lime, peach, nectarine and lychee flavors. Tangy and fresh on the finish, and more precise and delicate than most Argentinean Torront\u00e9s.","63966":"This is neutral on the nose except for green banana and white grapefruit hints. It feels melony, with flavors that match the mouthfeel in the form of melon and nectarine. This is flabby on the finish, needing more cut and zest.","63987":"This light-pink Malbec smells dry, oaky and bereft of fruit. A plump palate feels a touch resiny from six months of American-oak aging, while this wine tastes vaguely of wood, vanilla, cherry Pixie stick and powdered sugar.","63999":"Brambly berry and leather aromas are rustic. This Malbec is hard and acidic. Short, generic plum and berry flavors don't expand or improve on the finish.","64175":"This wine needs air in order to get at its dark-fruit aromas. In the mouth, this blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cab Franc is ripe but smacks down hard with tannins. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and herbs end with complex notes of graphite and chalk. This gets better the more time you spend with it. Drink through 2024.","64338":"This is top-notch Argentine Cabernet Franc. Savory, exotic, oaky blueberry and blackberry aromas set up a bold palate with ample acidity and modest tannins. Berry flavors and oak spice are the key flavors, while a buttery oak note and a pinch of salt rise up on the finish. Drink now through 2018.","64356":"Ripe, deep aromas of cassis and marzipan evolve to show minerality. A big, chunky palate features flavors of baked blackberry, cassis and chocolate, while a mild, somewhat languorous finish is chewy and leaves a lasting taste of prune. Drink now through 2018.","64515":"This is a clean, basic wine with white-fruit aromas of peach and apple. The palate is well balanced, and there's a good level of citrus flavor along with green herb accents. On the finish, it's more tropical, with a hint of banana.","64561":"This is Torrontes in its pure, true form. Trapiche has captured the light, floral essence of the grape and wrapped it in an oily but smooth package that houses lovely green apple and papaya flavors. With structure, flavor and balance, this wine will go well with a wide range of summer foods.","64564":"A complete Argentinean Merlot with aromas of light oak, fresh berries and spice that all come together in harmony. The palate is a little chewy and grabby, but it tastes and feels real and full, with good tannins. For a ripe wine it isn't conflicted, over the top or challenging. Drink now through 2009.","64658":"Neutral aromas of apple and peach kick it off, then round citrus and a mild hint of pickled vegetable and apple carry the palate. This is a fleshy, basic Chardonnay with youthful bounce and a touch of additional pickle on the finish. Drink soon.","64661":"Stemmy on the nose, with aromas of rhubarb, pie cherry and sucking candy. The palate is also candied, with a lean, fresh mouthfeel and floral, red-fruit flavors. Not a lot of darkness or concentration, but it does seem floral and refreshing. Shows some heat and scour on the finish.","64664":"Hints of wisteria and lemon blossom give this dilute Chardonnay a respectable bouquet, while the palate is mild and tastes like bites of lemon, apple and orange. There's not much weight or stuffing to it, but it's generally clean and inoffensive.","64728":"Dark, smoky black-fruit aromas include graphite. This is round, chewy and balanced on the palate, with ripe but standard flavors of cassis, blackberry and black pepper. Notes of burnt toast and char appear on a solid, ripe finish.","64737":"Punchy red fruit aromas and plum notes give this Malbec energy up front. A ripe, round palate feels good and right. Spicy plum flavors with an herbal note finish woody, salty and with rubbery, lively tannins. Drink through 2019.","64862":"This is tight and sturdy as a rock up front, with licorice, hard spice, leather and black cherry aromas. It feels round, chewy, tough and healthy, with flavors of baked black fruit, chocolate, molasses and hickory. Roasted and oaky, but cool and collected. Drink now through 2016.","64871":"The nose is deep and dense, delivering pure blackberry and blueberry aromas along with toast and herb notes. It feels balanced and pure as a cloudless night, with controlled blackberry, spice and chocolate flavors. Strong on the finish, with bitter notes of chocolate and espresso, and narrow tannins.","64906":"Cigar box, green olive, herbal notes and field scents define the bouquet on this single-vineyard Cabernet. With bright acidity, the palate displays raciness along with oak-driven flavors of chocolate, mint, vanilla and herbal berry fruits. A lasting finish is spicy, herbal and mildly green in flavor.","64907":"After an opening of tomato, red plum and berry aromas, this shows a smooth texture and a full body. Berry, ripe plum and cocoa flavors finish with medium tannins and good length.","64912":"A wide, jammy nose is the greeting on this fleshy, full-bodied Cab. Additional aromas of rubber, latex and smoke give it weight and masculinity. This runs spicy and lightly herbal in terms of flavors, while wood spice, cinnamon and herbs compete with mocha and chocolaty black-fruit notes on the finish.","64913":"This warm-climate Chardonnay displays aromas of baked apple, toast and spice. It's resiny and heavy in the mouth, but there's enough acidity to maintain balance. Flavors of honeyed peach, baked apple, cinnamon and white pepper finish in tropical fashion, where banana is the lasting fruit note.","64950":"Dull and dilute, but painless. The palate is chunky but with enough acids to stay lively, and the flavors of green apple, lemon and pineapple are decent enough. Tangy and slightly bitter on the finish.","64956":"Bland and chunky, with aromas of talcum powder and apple. The palate feel is a mix of spritz and heft, and the flavors of melon and peach are pithy and lean toward bitter. Dusty and heavy on the finish, an indication that it won't last long and has already seen better days.","64957":"Roasted, oaky and resiny on the nose, and then the palate delivers a bolt of acidity that makes the wine feel pointy in the mouth. The flavors are herbal and resiny, with foresty black fruit at the core. Creamy and sticky on the finish, and overall it struggles to present a pure, balanced picture.","64972":"Herbal raspberry and strawberry aromas are raw and a bit green. This feels scratchy as well, with tomatoey flavors of red currant and plum skins. A modest finish is racy in feel but mild in flavor.","64977":"Light cherry and raspberry aromas come in front of a grabby rubbery palate. This tastes like salty plum, with little variation of that theme. A solid finish tastes exactly like what came before.","64986":"Flat cherry and clay aromas set up a scratchy, almost citric palate with short but bright plum and raspberry flavors. This is basic Malbec with a tart hollow wiry finish.","65171":"Murky aromas of earth and black fruits introduce a hard, grabby palate. Heavy oak creates a hickory flavor to go with roasted, herbal black-fruit notes, while this finishes sticky, resiny and oaky, with heat and grabby residual tannins.","65176":"Crisp, minerally aromas are low on fruit. Zesty, lively and citric on the palate, this tastes lean, linear and sharp, with orange notes and a salty aftertaste. A briny tasting, tangy finish fits the bill.","65355":"Harsh aromas are devoid of fruit. The mouthfeel is heavy and oily in texture, while the flavors are flat and suggestive of bitter melon.","65391":"This Chardonnay is slightly metallic and briny on the bouquet. It feels plump and chunky, with citrus and pineapple flavors coming in front of a quiet finish.","65392":"This Grigio opens with mild lemon and apple aromas that transition into a flabby palate and dull flavors of buttercup, banana and apple.","65393":"This is light on the nose, where minerally lime scents are barely detectable. The mouthfeel is fresh but dilute, while flavors of lemon, green apple and tarragon end in simple fashion.","65505":"Initial aromas of clove and cinnamon suggest a lot of barrel action, but give it a few minutes and the wine settles on ripe black fruit, dark spice notes and richness. It's big-boned but not overly tannic, and it exhibits Shiraz's bacon and espresso character in a good way.","65528":"Initially this smells like bell pepper and green bean more than ripe berry fruits, but with time in the glass it rounds into spicy, herbal form. A tight, reedy palate is bolstered by tomatoey acidity, while flavors of herbal raspberry and red currant finish with ripped tannins and plenty of residual acidity. Drink through 2024.","65559":"The soapy, flowery nose is not uncommon for this variety. The palate, meanwhile, is pointed and direct, with extracted citrus and white-grape flavors. Similar citric sharpness carries onto the finish.","65560":"Gaseous, rubbery aromas are a fair introduction to an edgy, bouncy type of Malbec. Cherry and plum flavors finish candied and also a little spicy. There's also some heat to this jumpy style of wine.","65562":"Neutral white-fruit aromas of peach, nectarine and melon are welcoming. This quaffer is juicy like orange juice, while flavors of mixed citrus fruits and nectarine finish peachy and lively, with a slight bitterness coming on late.","65711":"This is mellow on the nose, with a mix of minerality and standard apple aromas. The palate feels fresh due to cutting acidity, while apple, peach and melon flavors lead to a mild, healthy finish. Frankly, there's not much difference between this and Trivento's basic 2012 Reserva Chardonnay, which costs $10 less.","65735":"This is an elegant wine that shows that Argentinean reds can improve with time. Tobacco, clay dust and dry spice comprise the bouquet. It's tight and well structured in the mouth, with chocolate, herb and baked berry flavors. A chocolaty aftertaste completes the picture. Drink this blend of Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc now through 2015.","65759":"A heady but attractive bouquet of marzipan, balsam wood, blackberry, cassis and raisin introduce a loaded but well-balanced, full-bodied palate. Toast, chocolate and black fruit flavors finish with additional spice, chocolate and lustiness. Drink through 2019.","65763":"Revancha is a new line of wines from esteemed winemaker Roberto de la Mota. This blends Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cab Franc. On the nose, it is spicy, lightly herbal and deep in fruit. A tight palate shows raw tannins and flavors of wild berry and oak-based coconut. Dry, flashy and a bit rough on the finish, this will benefit from a few more years in bottle. Drink through 2020.","65767":"This stylish wine opens with a floral, perfumed, high-altitude bouquet that shows red currant and raspberry aromas. Like the nose, the palate is fresh and not ponderous. Crisp raspberry and cassis flavors finish with freshness and elegance. Drink through 2020.","65774":"This is top-notch Argentine Cabernet Franc. Savory, exotic, oaky blueberry and blackberry aromas set up a bold palate with ample acidity and modest tannins. Berry flavors and oak spice are the key flavors, while a buttery oak note and a pinch of salt rise up on the finish. Drink now through 2018.","65827":"Savory but also stewy on the nose, this Malbec offers muddled berry and spiced cherry aromas. In the mouth, this is flush and jammy but not all that exact. Spicy, herbal, peppery plum and black-currant flavors finish with heat and roasted notes.","65841":"Familiar varietal aromas of lychee and scented candle come with a hint of petrol. Punchy and crisp in feel, this tastes of garden variety lemon-lime, banana and lychee. A crisp but rudimentary finish closes things out.","65855":"Aromas of vanilla and Animal crackers are light on fruit. Delicate on the palate, this offers lychee and tropical fruit flavors that suggest Torront\u00e9s. A pithy finish is braced by bright acidity.","65863":"Aromas of hard spices, licorice root and earth override any berry fruit notes this Cabernet blend shows. Round on the palate, with juicy acidity, this tastes of plum and spicy oak. A long, woody, spicy finish brings it home.","65883":"Three years ago Trapiche started making three high-end single-vineyard Malbecs; Aciar's seems a little more closed and flat than its cousins, but it does pump forward with rock-solid blackberry and cola flavors. It's better on the attack than the follow-through, but the flavors are excellent and the balance is proper even if the length is short.","65920":"Smoky, gritty black cherry and blackberry aromas are herbal and smell a bit like road tar. This is flush on the palate at first, then more tight and tannic. Flavors mostly reflect the nose, meaning this tastes gritty, peppery, toasted and herbal, with spicy berry flavors rolling out over the finish.","66071":"Fresh, minerally lime aromas set up a zesty palate with lemon-lime, pineapple and apple flavors. There's nothing complicated about this snappy white, which finishes with some bitterness and lasting acidity.","66073":"While this Cab may be a touch soupy and heavy on the nose, aromas of coffee grounds and berry fruits are good. A full, blocky palate features cheek-rubbing tannins, while this tastes of coffee, chocolate and herbal berry fruits. For everyday purposes, this makes the grade.","66096":"Medicinal, earthy aromas of cherry, raspberry and plum are encouraging. This blend of Malbec and Cab Franc is tight and sinewy, with good acidity. Cherry, plum and chocolate flavors rest comfortably in front of a ripe, full finish.","66270":"Berry, plum and cassis aromas, what many would call the usuals for CS, are present and accounted for. This offers good weight and nice tannins; flavors of red fruits are fairly oaked, while wood spice, plum and apple-skin flavors finish things off.","66272":"Soft and earthy up front, this Malbec deals jammy, raisiny aromas and a note of charcoal. The palate is cushioned in feel, while flavors of prune and blackberry are ripe but also minerally. Blackberry and raisin flavors are at the center of a lightly herbal,  persistent finish.","66324":"Starts out strong with lemon, apple and other fresh-fruit aromas. The flavors are more mealy and warm, and the palate feel is oily. Citrus, apple, lemon and tropical fruit all make appearances, but overall the wine fades into mediocrity and pithy bitterness.","66423":"Forced woody aromas and flavors are a persistent theme on this Uco Valley Malbec, which smells a bit horsey and stewed. Dense black-fruit flavors are roasted and peppery, while wood and related resin notes rise up on the back palate. Rustic power and fiery heat are loud elements on a fully oaked finish.","66481":"Aromas of cardamom and clove as well as heat make for a challenging nose. In the mouth, heavy fruit combined with chippy tannins create a clipped feel. Ripe berry flavors are a bit jumbled, with oaky spice notes stepping up. A flat chunky finish is missing skip in its stride. This is 85% Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.","66505":"Savory aromas of beef jerky blend with raisin, grainy oak and sauciness on the nose of this Syrah-led blend. An exceedingly ripe palate feels inky with low energy. Prune, raisin and cassis flavors are encumbered by heavy oak, while the finish tastes both chocolaty and like stewed plum.","66608":"Aromas of straw, dusty apple and mild citrus are clean as a whole. Citric acidity lends zest to an otherwise chunky, pithy palate. Flavors of citrus fruits and apple finish fresh, pithy and with a note of orange peel.","66724":"Waxy apple aromas are chunky, dusty and a bit choppy. Ditto the palate, which is thick and on the full side, with moderate acidity. Apple, savory oak and spice flavors finish with a briny, saline note.","66737":"Aromas of cantaloupe, tropical fruits and rubber lack continuity and seem a bit tired. On the palate, this ros\u00e9 is chunky and lazy, with low acidity. Flavors of orange peel and stone fruits finish with sweet, citric lift and moderate zest.","66739":"Toasty aromas fold in baked apple notes. Sharp, sizzling and high in acid, the palate is citric and tough to navigate. Flavors of orange, lemon and sour apple are no shock given the palate.","66756":"From longtime Catena winemakers Mariano de Paola and Pepe Galante, this is a deep, black-fruited Malbec with a cushioned bouquet, violet notes and delightful blackberry character. The palate is deep, juicy, healthy and balanced, and the finish is smooth and offers a whiff of coconut. Solid, serious and good now through 2013.","66894":"This is a ripe oaky specimen with smoky aromas of hickory along with licorice, pencil lead and jammy blackberry. In the mouth, it's huge and spreads out like a blanket. Flavors of baked black fruits are fully ripe, while oak-driven toasty, blackened, chocolaty flavors push the finish. Drink through 2018.","66959":"Jammy, soft blueberry aromas are a touch green. This is syrupy, heavy and sticky on the palate, with chocolate, prune and peppery flavors. Tannic and heavy on the finish, this is an overweight Malbec that's lush to the point of being fat.","66968":"Dark-berry aromas are crisp and show a note of minerality as well as barrel char. This is firm, juicy and modest in structure, with flavors of blackberry and cassis touched up by some oak. A non-pushy finish with a hint of mocha is a good close.","66999":"A gamy, slightly stemmy and rubbery style of Bonarda that reflects the variety, Mendoza's terroir and the vineyard. Which doesn't mean that it's great; far from it, the wine is good but stemmy, with green-ish notes and reedy accents infiltrating the red-fruit flavors that control the palate. Solid and structured, but still it leaves something to be desired.","67000":"Sort of sweet and gaseous to start, with rubbery, medicinal aromas. The palate is tight and closed, with warm, crusty dark-fruit flavors, an herbal influence and heat. Thus the finish is a little fiery and peppery, and there's chop and bite to the overall feel. A kitchen-sink blend of Malbec, Bonarda and Syrah.","67002":"Pretty good and solid for an uncommon blend, but the Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio thrown together results in nice buttercup aromas along with some apple pie and pear. The palate runs sweet but maintains its freshness, and the flavors of apple, pear, melon and powdered sugar come together. A novelty wine that shows the right signs.","67037":"A tidal wave of toasty char hits like a hammer and dominates the nose. Plump but also jammy and heavy, this tastes oaky, herbal and like candied raspberry, currant and burnt toast. Savory, toasty oak rides high on a finish with residual herbal flavors.","67076":"Sweet blackberry and black cherry aromas are accented by mint leaf and woodspice, while the palate is slightly more narrow and snappy than you might expect, with cherry, raspberry and cough drop flavors. A little high in acidity and snap, with medicinal cherry on the finish.","67251":"Rubbery generic berry aromas are more damp than bright. This feels drying and scrubbing due to rough tannins. Toasty black-plum flavors are short and foresty, while this tastes toasty on a dry finish.","67256":"Smoke and burnt rubber are prominent aromas. This PV feels grabby and pushy, with hard tannins. Creamy candied-berry flavors are sweet and chocolaty, while this tastes of oak, caramel and vanilla on the finish.","67280":"Tropical fruit and citrus aromas turn toward air freshener and bath soap upon airing. This feels standard for Torront\u00e9s, maybe even a bit flabby, with lychee and melon flavors that finish chalky.","67344":"Plenty of charcoal, toast and resin work the bouquet, while the fruit seems a little candied. There's a mix of black berry notes and oak, which results in a creamy mouthfeel and lingering vanilla and sweetness. A complete Malbec, but one that's neither unique nor overly special.","67476":"Macho grapy aromas are offset by spunky raspberry scents. Fruity and a bit narrow and grabby across the palate, this delivers Mendoza's patented black-fruit flavors wrapped in chocolaty oak. Spice and oak remain present on a full finish.","67625":"This blend of Malbec, Bonarda, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is oaky and minty up front, with pencil lead and exotic blueberry aromas. In the mouth, this has a fast pulse, while flavors of Middle Eastern spices, cassis and blueberry finish briny but short.","67709":"Lemon rind and prune are the primary aromas, but there's also a hint of green bean in here. The palate is dark and concentrated but not exactly high voltage in terms of power. Flavors of raisin, cassis, fig and chocolate are rich and ripe, while the finish runs dark. Almost overripe but seemingly more jammy than overdone. Drink now through 2012.","67714":"A touch raisiny but lusty and rich, with licorice, mint, black plum and fruitcake aromas. The palate is mouthfilling despite rather pointed acidity, and thus the flavors of juicy blackberry, cherry, pepper and coffee are accurate and appropriate. Long, toasty and yet again slightly raisiny on the finish. Drink now; 300 cases made.","67721":"Heavy and dark, with licorice, fruit syrup and blackberry pie aromas. The palate is lush, deep and chugging along at max ripeness, while the flavor profile pushes blackberry and prune flavors. Roasted and coffee-laden on the finish, with a ripe, ready personality. Drink now.","67747":"Inky, dark and smoky on the nose, this bold Malbec also shows aromas of rubber and turned earth. A blocky, chewy, raw mouthfeel and saucy, herbal flavors of plum and boysenberry combine into a tough, gritty, tannic whole, while the finish is saucy, with oregano and thyme flavors that suggest rag\u00f9.","67758":"Herbal, jammy aromas of raspberry and plum are spicy but reedy. This feels a bit heavy and out of shape. Stewy, baked blackberry flavors are interwoven with herb and spice notes, while this Malbec-Cabernet blend tastes mostly of chocolate, prune and herbs on a chunky finish.","67956":"Compact on the bouquet, with a pointed combo of boysenberry and blackberry aromas. The palate is full, with plenty of acidity and stuffing. Flavors of blackberry, olive, fig and chocolate are likable and the finish is loud and powerful in typical South American style. Better value than the higher-priced Kinien Cab. Drink now through 2012.","67961":"Sweet, forward aromas of mocha, blackberry, cotton candy and vanilla signal a rich wine. The palate is round and chunky, with a spot of elegance but more size and force. Flavors of chunky blackberry are slightly salty and salinic at the edges, while overall it's thick, fruity and black in nature. Drink now through 2012.","68049":"Angular plum aromas are grapy and display a lavender note. This is fairly full in body, with a slight syrupy quality to the palate. Black-fruit flavors are powerful but finish with rough, bumpy tannins.","68051":"Reedy aromas of olive, leather and oak are less than fruity and lush. This has a hard, edgy, abrasive mouthfeel along with pinched, salty flavors of plum and berry fruits. Earthy berry flavors and drying tannins are in charge on the finish.","68244":"Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas are toasty at first, then charred as this breathes. A big grabby palate is muscled up but welcoming. Toasty blackberry and cassis flavors remain charred on a loaded lengthy finish. This is Malbec and Petit Verdot fermented and aged together. Drink through 2022.","68248":"Foresty plum and berry aromas are spunky and more high toned than dense. This Malbec is fresh with smacking tannins. Lightly herbal berry flavors convey an Old World sense, while this finishes with developed spice and oaky maple notes. Drink through 2024.","68255":"Ripe grapy aromas are more chunky than mammoth. Saturated and muscular on the palate, this tastes of roasted salty blackberry, while the finish is full and meaty in both flavor and texture. Drink this stout full-bodied Malbec through 2022.","68345":"Dark woody mossy aromas are heavy, ripe and suggest raisin and prune. This Syrah is stacked and dense on the palate, with hard tannins that pinch. Blackened burnt flavors of blackberry, toast, baking spices, campfire and bacon finish with overt, dominating oak.","68346":"Dense woody aromas come with notes of damp earth, coffee grounds and eucalyptus nut. On the palate, this blend of Malbec and 7% Petit Verdot is high in acidity but also resiny from oak treatment. Salty plum and tomato flavors give way to a tidal wave of oak flavor on the finish. Drink through 2025.","68443":"Leafy woody berry and graphite aromas are on the spot for Cabernet. This feels bold and saturated, with no holes in the palate. Lightly herbal flavors of plum and blackberry are darkened by a wave of chocolate, while this tastes of mocha and chocolate on a plush but energetic finish.","68461":"An earthy heavily oaked nose includes jammy notes of spiced black plum. A thick beefy chewy palate delivers savory herbal black-fruit flavors. A blocky finish is tannic, and overall the sum is about equal to its parts. Drink through 2021.","68515":"Blueberry and cassis aromas come in front of a narrow, rubbery palate. Rubbery, earthy plum and dark-berry flavors end with grabby tannins and herbal, salty, briny notes.","68527":"The bouquet is stylish and rooty, with black-fruit and chocolate scents leading the charge. It shows good structure, meaning it's full but not too thick or jammy. Flavors of ripe blackberry and plum are generous and a touch rubbery, while the finish is full and mildly tannic.","68532":"A high-end Malbec experience at a reasonable price, this boasts rich aromas of cola, graphite and boysenberry that leap from the glass. The palate is bright and just thick enough, with wild berry, cherry, plum and oak-based flavors. Another whack of oak, along with vanilla, chocolate and tobacco flavors, graces the finish. Drink now\u20132015.","68556":"This Syrah leads with standard berry and chocolate aromas. The mouthfeel is largely fresh, and while there's creamy oak as part of the flavor package, there's also good berry character and mint.","68618":"Big and forceful and loaded with coconut, mint, blackberry and boysenberry aromas that settle on inky. Quite juicy and tight in the mouth, with sharp acidity and oak-based flavors of vanilla, spice and licorice accenting blackberry fruit. Finishes steady, bright and fresh, but sharp on the acidity. Drink now through 2016.","68633":"Saucy raspberry aromas are herbal and briny. This feels chunky and round. Jammy raspberry flavors turn medicinal and herbal, ending with notes of latex and Band-Aid.","68773":"Licorice and warm blacktop make for a dark nose, yet there isn't much base to the acidic palate. There's grabby, tangy generic fruit but mostly tartness and sizzle. An edgy wine with a spot of mocha on a sharp finish.","68774":"Smells like a field of wild flowers and weeds on a hot summer's day. There's sweaty leather and rhubarb along with murky, mildly soupy berry flavors. Lacks proper balance and freshness, and instead shows a weedy, sticky side.","68776":"Consistent with the mediocre 2006. This amounts to generic red wine in a catchy, youthful package. It offers basic raspberry and strawberry aromas and flavors along with scouring acidity. It's bouncy and free-flowing, but hardly what we'd call an elevated premium wine.","68777":"Hard and fiery, with spearmint dominating the nose. Raw and jumpy in the mouth, with hard berry and coffee flavors. Not much else to say about this tough wine; it's a fighter not a lover. Imported by USA Wine Imports.","68778":"Raw, rubbery and just not that good of a wine. Bramble, leather and compost muscle out any fruit aromas, and on the palate it's perky to the point of being acidic. Lacks balance while burning up everything in its path.","68781":"Minty and sheer on the nose, and that's a prime indicator of what's to come, namely high-toned, lean fruit flavors and an abundance of scouring, protruding acidity. Some oak lingers to soften things, but overall this is a sharp, underdeveloped style of Cabernet.","68786":"Forced together and not happily married is the only way to describe this dysfunctional coupling of sweet, tropical Torrontes and heavy, cloying Chardonnay. Too sweet for most palates, with a heavy dosage of melon, lychee and table sugar.","68849":"Modest peach and apple aromas rise up on a quiet nose. Active acidity adds punch to a fairly standard palate that conveys stone fruits, tangy citrus and salt. A mildly briny finish runs heavy on malic acid.","68855":"Saucy plum and cherry aromas are respectable but unsophisticated. This Malbec feels full and rugged, with hard tannins. Generic berry flavors include a note of prune, while this tastes herbal and slightly chocolaty on the finish.","69298":"Sturdy on the nose, this has cherry and red berry aromas. The palate is juicy, lively and fun, with crisp, focused red-plum and cassis flavors. Easy to quaff.","69301":"Purple in color, this wine has grapy aromas. It feels potent yet pointy, with heavy extraction and high acidity for such a dark, berry-packed wine. The black fruit and pepper flavors are solid, and the finish is tight, with warmth and mild bitterness.","69306":"Grassy and scattered on the nose, with alfalfa, mint, berry and a note of agave or Tequila. It feels sticky at first but solid, with an herbal, minty flavor that is copied on the finish.","69344":"Starts with baked, candied, mildly raisiny aromas that hint at expiration, but the wine has good grab and acidity on the palate along with dry fruit flavors, licorice and spice. Persistent but not special, with a light, supple finish. It's 72% Malbec with Bonarda and Syrah.","69351":"A simple, jammy-smelling wine with cherry aromas and a whiff of citrus too. Young, vibrant, acidic and juicy on the palate, with energetic but rubbery berry and plum flavors. Good yet basic wine overall, with heat on the finish.","69352":"Gritty, medicinal, almost reduced aromas of blueberry are devoid of softness, while the palate is also kind of tight and tough. Seems more clipped and underdone than the 2005, with narrow tannins and a medicinal burn. Has its merits and its intentions seem true, but something's not quite clicking here.","69434":"Subtle aromas of minerals, rose petal and red berry are not overdone. In the mouth, it has astringency, hard tannins and an overall narrow feel. Flavors of raspberry and red plum seem sharp and jagged, while oaky mint and heat rise up on the finish. Give this more bottle time and it may improve.","69816":"This high-altitude Malbec, purportedly the highest in the world, seems to have touched the sun. This is flat-out stewed, pruny and flat, with floral grapy exotic aromas. It's not balanced and the acidity is very low, but still this offers some interesting notes.","69818":"Burnt slightly acrid aromas lead to a grabby palate. This tastes more salty than fruity, while a note of spent lees creates a wheaty flavor. A low fruit quotient is contiguous from nose to palate to finish.","69853":"Aromas of Christmas spice, black cherry and latex feed into a fresh, juicy palate with sharp acidity. Pie cherry and red plum flavors finish raw in feel and peppery in flavor. This is all about chop, chop, chop.","70032":"Vegetal-leaning, stewy aromas of plum and jammy berry are saucy. This feels sticky and low in acidity. Grassy, herbal plum and berry flavors are a bit green on the finish.","70146":"Tight lightly charred blackberry and cassis aromas open this blend of Malbec and Cab Franc. In the mouth, this is flush, stacked, tannic and dense. Black-fruit flavors of cassis and black plum include baking-spice notes, while this ends with toasty, spicy, blackened flavors. Drink through 2020.","70164":"Rich blueberry aromas come with hints of cardamom, anise and lettuce leaf. The palate feels compact and dense, with reduction and modest acidity. Flavors of blueberry and baking spices finish firm, long and exotic, much like the nose.","70179":"This is a direct, almost raw type of Cabernet. The nose deals spice, herb and dry-fruit aromas. The palate feels lively and alert, with firm acidity driving flavors of berry fruits, oak, herbs and spice. The finish is long, committed and spicy in nature, with a fair amount of oak.","70321":"Gritty, green aromas are not really ripe or friendly. This is high in pyrazines and tastes peppery and largely fruitless. A sour finish with sweaty notes are as expected given the nose and flavors.","70336":"This Salta blend of Malbec and Tannat smells a lot like fresh road tar. The palate is adequately cushioned, while hard, stalky, roasted berry flavors are oaky. This has a lot of disparate parts but the whole has issues and is sketchy.","70337":"Stewy, jammy plum and currant aromas are less than inviting. This feels choppy, with hard tannins. Soupy, weedy berry flavors end with minty, herbal, grassy notes.","70347":"One of the Uco Valley's highest vineyards has produced an awkward, funky, clunky Chardonnay with butterscotch, mustard and heavy oak aromas. Flavors of mustard and barrel resin follow the nose, while this finishes with pickled notes, a pinched mouthfeel and a sense of skins. Salentein needs to reassess this wine, which is new to its lineup.","70352":"Herbal, funky, rustic and green on the nose, this isn't terribly appealing up front. A clunky palate without much flow doesn't offer much help, while this blend tastes weedy and grassy.","70358":"This wine is living evidence of how Torront\u00e9s doesn't take well to oak and aging. The nose is clumsy and heavy, with a resiny note of lemon cleanser. Flavors of pickled citrus and sauerkraut hang around on the finish, which heads south.","70416":"Concentrated black fruit aromas are subtle and don't push real hard. It's jammy, deep and soft in the mouth, with sweet tannins and even sweeter core berry flavors and oak. Finishes smooth, with barrel influence and warmth. Very nice as always, but not as elevated and exact as prior vintages.","70428":"Thick and sultry smelling, with aromas of menthol, mint, tobacco, leather and ripe black fruits. Feels good but oaky, with resiny tannins and baked berry and vanilla flavors. Dark, toasty and mellow on the finish. Shows ripeness, balance and lots of oak. Drink now through 2014.","70479":"This light and refreshing SB offers mild apple and citrus aromas, a snappy, citric palate and basic flavors of green apple and lime. As a whole, it's a cleansing but fairly standard wine.","70548":"This is cool, earthy and tight on the nose. Then it opens and blooms, with classy roasted notes that set the stage for a smooth-rolling palate with bold blackberry, herb and chocolate flavors. By the time it finishes, complex bitter-chocolate and toast notes have taken over. This is primed and ready to drink.","70565":"This is a cuddly, jammy, ripe Malbec with maple, blackberry and oak aromas. It feels weighty and lush, with large-scale boysenberry, blackberry and blueberry flavors. It turns a little soft and basic on the finish, but there's no griping about this wine's purity and fruit content.","70689":"Brambly, leathery aromas of berry fruits, plum and spice set up a high-acid, broad palate with a strong sense of brightness and electricity. Flavors of roasted berries come with raciness and notes of spice and chocolate. Things remain zesty and bright on the finish, where residual acidity creates energy to spare. Drink through 2019.","70691":"Stout, smoky aromas revolve around thick berry scents and minerally notes. This is rock solid in the mouth but not too heavy. Jammy blackberry, spice and herbal flavors are generous, while the finish is lightly oaked, with modest toast, vanilla and chocolate notes along with mint.","70726":"Ripe raisiny aromas of spiced fruit cake are heavy and sweet. Matching the nose, this Bonarda feels thick and chunky with grating tannins. Flavors of chocolaty black fruits are oaky, spicy and minty, while this is equally woody on the finish.","70727":"Gritty plum and berry flavors are a touch rough. This is tight on the palate, but fair. Dry flavors of minty oak and clove are more out front than salty berry notes, while this is firm and tastes like roasted fruit, oak and salted tomato on the finish.","70818":"Dusty cherry, wild berry and minerally aromas comprise a compact, deep nose that's entirely inviting. Juicy, bold and bright on the palate, with sturdy tannins, this offers exotic notes of cumin and baking spices along with wild berry flavors. It's elegant, complete and thorough on the finish; drink through 2020.","70823":"Round, earthy blackberry aromas are dressed up in dry spice and oak. A fleshy, pure palate has bounce to its step, while oaky, toasty flavors of baked black fruits, cocoa and spice finish with just the right amount of cutting acidity and flavors of baking spices. Drink this Cabernet Franc-led blend through 2020.","70941":"Aromas of wet cement, pencil eraser, plastic, vanilla and jammy blueberry come in front of a racy palate with pronounced acidity and flavors of spiced cherry, plum and herbs. A long finish with power beats its chest before flattening out and turning heavy.","70944":"Heavy oak greets you on the nose in the form of shoe polish and blackened aromas. This feels ripe, solid and woody, with good structure. Flavors of plum, mint and oak resin turn spicy and minty if given time, while the finish is driven by crisp acidity and plum and raspberry flavors.","70945":"Dry aromas of leafy, spicy red-berry fruits register as complex and mature. Medium in body, it has integrated tannins and acids. Flavors of lightly baked cherry and sweet red currant are earthy and finish with notes of cocoa powder, raspberry and plum. Drink now.","70986":"Jammy raspberry and plum aromas come with accents of dusty herbs and black licorice. A saturated, lush, jammy palate features soft, baked flavors of cassis and wild berry, while the finish delivers mint, chocolate and lasting berry ripeness. Drink through 2019.","70989":"Opaque to the eye, this is rich, heady and full of inky blackberry aromas and notes of graphite, balsam wood, tobacco and coconut. A lush, mile-deep palate offers chocolaty flavors of blackberry, roasted meat and salt. Ripe black-fruit flavors dominate a lush finish. Drink through 2020.","71125":"Simple aromas may lack vibrancy but aren't offputting. And frankly speaking, it's nice to smell soft berry fruit and not much else (namely burnt or buttery oak). The palate, meanwhile, is plump, bright and full of clean but basic boysenberry fruit. Finishes thin but sturdy.","71131":"This wine shows molasses and Boston baked beans on the nose along with peppery spice. The bouquet is a touch stewy, but the palate delivers core black cherry and cola along with tight, ripe tannins. The wine takes a little while to warm up and it remains saucy, but that's not uncommon for Mendoza.","71133":"A difficult wine to assess. For starters, it's heavily oaked and very dark in aromas; think tar, char and espresso. The palate is narrowly focused and tannic, with dark fruit peeking thru here and there. Finishes sheer, with coffee and bitter chocolate. Could get better with time, or it might never really open up. Needs at least another year in bottle to show its true colors.","71256":"Early aromas of sea shell and chalk dust transition first to apricot and mango and later to wood grain. This wine feels plump but dilute, with moderate intensity and depth. Flavors of tropical fruits, banana and dry oak evaporate on the finish into undefined mildness.","71268":"Deep purple in color, with jammy boysenberry aromas, this smells like it has a burnt topping. Formless on the palate, this is mostly a big, extracted, scattered Malbec that's grapy and dark but devoid of complexities.","71283":"Jammy, brambly aromas of grassy blueberry and balsamic vinegar make for a rough entry. This feels chunky, grabby and hard, while flavors of lactic oak and herbal blueberry are strained. A spicy, green-leaning finish comes with a final dose of hard tannins.","71329":"Despite showing a yellow color and gritty oiliness on the nose, this feels round and complete, with tropical flavors of mango, papaya and green melon. Everything about this is mild, inoffensive and tropical. Drink now before it starts to fade.","71334":"Reduced rubbery aromas of blackberry and black currant come with a touch of mushroom. This is extracted, heavy and blocky on the palate, while baked blackberry flavors are massive but short on elegance. Bitter coffee flavors, rugged tannins and stickiness make for a heavy finish.","71339":"Woody and dense at first, this smells bright and fruity as it opens. A solid palate houses lightly toasted flavors of blackberry that turn more peppery and toasty on a fairly oaky finish.","71347":"Jammy muscled-up aromas of blackberry show hints of spice, especially red chili flake. This feels full, round and comfortable, with moderate tannic clamp. Herbal black-fruit flavors finish bold, with a touch of dry bitter oak.","71353":"Brushy aromas of field herbs blend with scents of oaky vanilla, plastic and stalky berry fruits. This feels saturated and rubbery. A salty flavor profile holds onto the bouquet's stalky character, while the finishing flavors are peppery and herbal, with a hint of sweet plastic derived from oak.","71421":"Over the years, Altimus\u2014a blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Tannat\u2014has been all over the map. This vintage is quite good, with burly aromas of bacon, balsam wood, campfire and black fruit. It's a load in the mouth, where minty, lemony oak flavors vie with blackberry and foresty herb notes. Leather and tobacco flavors appear on the feisty finish.","71424":"This is a solid, well-crafted and flavorful Malbec. Black fruit and cocoa aromas set up a concentrated palate, bearing chewy, dense flavors of black plum, wild berry and chocolate, plus toast and pepper notes. Production is 100,000-plus cases.","71439":"Good but not excessively expressive on the bouquet, this reveals a milk chocolate element that emerges after the wine airs. The flavor profile starts with a lemony oak note, with notes of blackberry, herb and peppery spice underneath. The nice finish is modest, like the bouquet. Only 300 cases made.","71440":"This is big and yellowish in color, which is usually an indicator of strong barrel character. And indeed, it's very oaky and resiny on the nose, palate and finish. But in between the waves of wood spice, vanilla and resin are complexities, fine acidity, good textural balance and sweet, tropical fruit flavors. Drink now.","71575":"A big step up from the prior year; the bouquet is spicy, dry, minerally and offers attractive dried flower aromas. The mouthfeel is pure, easygoing and slightly creamy, while the flavors suggest dried raspberry, plum and vanilla for sweetness. Toasty and dry on the finish; elegant for Argentinean PN.","71579":"Opens with mildly baked aromas but there's enough fresh fruit, fine herbs and lavender to make it inviting. The palate is narrow and tight but clean and lively, with herbal berry flavors and plenty of power. Finishes long but lean, with cleansing acids. Will go well with an array of foods.","71652":"While Argentine Malbecs aren't textbook cellaring wines, this one has enough spirit, tannin and structure to benefit from a few years on its side. Now, it's lush on the nose, with ripe berry, pencil eraser, vanilla and marzipan aromas. The palate is chewy but well built, with dense blackberry, cassis, coconut and chocolate flavors. On the finish, things only intensify. Will be at its best around 2015\u20132016.","71669":"This Torront\u00e9s is a bit oily on the nose, with citrusy scents of orange and pineapple lurking in the background. In the mouth, it's a zinger, with sharp acids and a mix of tropical flavors and green apple. This finishes fresh and lean.","71801":"This opens with mostly toast and barrel char, but airing allows chocolate and spice aromas into play. This Malbec feels tight, stout and chewy, with fresh acidity and firm tannins. Black-fruit flavors are toasty all the way to a peppery spicy finish. Drink through 2021.","71804":"Berry and black-plum aromas are dense. This wine from silt (limo) soils feels a bit tannic and rugged. Flavors of plum and berry fruits are spicy, while the finish is savory tasting and long, with moderate complexity. Drink through 2021.","71824":"Minerally and firm on the nose, it bursts with blackberry and plum aromas. In the mouth, this is lively and medium bodied, while nice acidity allows it to roll over the palate while showing earthy flavors of black fruits and rubber. A saucy, leathery, meaty-tasting finish is friendly in feel.","71825":"Los Tanos hails from La Consulta in the Uco Valley, as does its brothers, Los Turcos and Los Gallegos. As stated in the Turcos and Gallegos reviews, these wines are triplets in terms of their oaky, creamy, sweet characteristics and overt richness. Tasted side by side by side, they are almost one in the same, with an emphasis on creamy oak, resiny mouthfeels and ripe berry fruits.","71826":"This oaky, creamy Malbec is one of Karim Mussi Saffie's trilogy of 2011 La Consulta single-vineyard varietals, and they are so similar in aromas, body weight, flavors and high oak levels that they are virtually interchangeable. Like its bretheren, this pours on the wood, vanilla, graphite, pencil eraser and resin along with sweet blackberry and cassis flavors. Maybe with time in the bottle it'll gain more individuality.","71835":"This smells of raw oak, cinnamon and clove, with its fruit essence entirely in the background. It's creamy, chewy and tannic on the palate, with herbal, oaky, resiny flavors of baking spice and modest raspberry.","71903":"Roasted fruit, road tar and barrel notes play a big role on the nose, which is otherwise regular and not particularly individual. The palate offers red-fruit jam, butter and pepper flavors, while the finish has some bite and definitive snap. Plenty good enough to drink but lacking completeness and texture.","72255":"Horsey berry aromas join forces with molasses, vanilla and graphite. Ripped with power, this Malbec's tartaric acidity is amplified and scratchy. Baked plum, blackberry and vanilla flavors end with abrasive residual acidity that creates length but also edginess. Drink through 2021.","72317":"This hefty dark Malbec is full on the nose, with aromas of tree bark, cola and muscled-up black fruits. A flush jammy palate tips the scale, while peppery, lightly herbal blackberry flavors simmer with toasty oak in front of a balanced finish that echoes with herbal afternotes. Drink through 2022.","72375":"This wine starts with light melon and stone-fruit aromas on the nose. The palate brings a light bubble bead along with dry, briny citrus flavors and a touch of tropical papaya and mango. This brut nature is clean, fresh, zesty and citrusy on the finish.","72376":"Core berry aromas are fresh and solid, while nuances of wild herbs, leather and smoky rubber give this Malbec some character out of the chute. A jammy, fairly lush palate gives flavors of plum, raspberry and cassis. On the finish, this is solid and doesn't change much. Drink at any point over the next few years.","72380":"Composed, well-oaked, earthy aromas of blackberry get this Bonarda going in the right direction. This is snappy and high in acid, but that ensures freshness and liveliness. Pointy cherry and raspberry flavors finish crisp and tangy.","72424":"Orange blossom and other common white fruit aromas make for a standard, generic type of bouquet. The palate is regular in feel and weight, with shy flavors of melon and apple. Entirely middle of the road in aromas, body, feel and flavors.","72430":"Smells both nutty and warm as well as citric and sharp. The palate keeps that pace; it's citrusy and cidery in feel, with orange, banana and spice flavors. Finishes quick and a little heavy. 70% Chardonnay and 30% Sauvignon Blanc.","72480":"The dark and penetrating aromas of violets, shoe polish, blackberry and road tar are solid. This feels a bit tough on the palate, with narrow tannins and flavors of rubber and black plum.","72565":"This pitch-dark Malbec from Cafayate is concentrated and heavy on the nose, with grapy blackberry aromas that are doing their best to stay fresh and clean. A full-force, grapy palate deals chocolaty black-fruit flavors in front of a warm finish where toasty oak and graphite notes come onto the scene.","72573":"Gritty, earthy aromas of hot tarmac and leathery plum give off a burnt character. Easy, smooth and flush across the palate, this blend of 70% Petit Verdot and 30% Malbec tastes peppery, spicy and of roasted black fruits. Toastiness carries over to the finish, which deals burnt, peppery spice notes and mild heat.","72581":"This Malbec is strangely exotic, with unusual floral aromas that blend in Middle Eastern spices including cardamom. Massive and borderline over-extracted, this tastes earthy and baked, with herbal blackberry flavors. A blackened, peppery flavor dominates a finish that comes across as stewed.","72582":"Dark in color and ripe from the get go, this Malbec blend smells of blackberry, graphite and licorice. Full and layered, with surprisingly good depth, this tastes of black fruits blended with tomato and plum. Spicy, dry and herbal tasting on the finish, with a hint of saltiness.","72845":"Orange peel and lychee aromas are typical of the variety. This feels straightforward, juicy, clean and fresh, with tangy acidity. Flavors of lime, lychee and tangerine finish bright and snappy.","72861":"Neutral aromas and a mouthfeel with modest lemony acidity set up pithy citrus flavors and notes of green melon and lychee. The finish on this tropical-tasting wine is creamy and a bit heavy, with lime and green banana flavors. Drink right away.","72958":"This Malbec-driven blend is concentrated up front, with staunch aromas of espresso, balsamic vinegar, leather, raw oak and mixed black fruits. This is big and lush, but vaguely focused on the midpalate. Flavors of berry fruits, toast and balsamic brine end with cushion and moderate structure. Drink through 2022.","72963":"Ripe, warm aromas of leather, licorice and baked black plum are the greeting on this Malbec-led blend. In the mouth, it's extracted, jammy and moderately tannic. Flavors of blackberry, vanilla, marshmallow and chocolate are derived from healthy fruit and plenty of oak. A long, spicy, woody finish offers a lot to chew on. Drink through 2021.","72969":"Berry and cherry aromas are friendly, clean and offer spice accents. This is full, ripe and tannic, with blackberry, dark spice and chocolaty flavors. Toasty menthol and hard spice notes on the finish confirm intensity and overall quality.","72989":"Tropical fruit, vanilla cookie and lemony citrus aromas set up a fresh, lithe palate with minerally lime and lychee flavors. This is as pure as they come, with a crisp-as-a-whistle finish. Drink prior to fall 2014.","73038":"Creamy oak, carob and foxy, gamy berry aromas open this racy Malbec that's fresh and exercising firm tannic grip. Black-fruit flavors are lightly herbal, while this is stout on the finish, with bright acidity and enduring freshness. Drink through 2019.","73042":"Trapiche is doing all sorts of experiments with terroirs and soils, and this Malbec is from vineyards planted on top of clay. On the nose, it's oaky, with notes of clove, mint and barrel spice accenting black-fruit scents. A full chewy palate deals spicy oaky minty blackberry flavors in front of a chocolaty finish with wood spice and minty berry notes. Drink through 2019.","73271":"Ripe, jammy aromas of smashed blueberry are elevated by hints of herbs and cola. A layered and lively mouthfeel is a big plus on this plot-selection Malbec, while blackberry, herb and smoked-meat flavors finish firm fresh and with depth. Drink through 2022.","73287":"Minty, floral aromas veer toward darker notes of cola, forest floor and leather. The palate is medium-full, with grabby tannins and roasted flavors of blackberry mixed with herbs and spice. A regular, oaky style of Cabernet with a raw, grabby mouthfeel.","73365":"Tropical, floral aromas are modest but enchanting. Plump and balanced on the palate, this blend tastes a bit yeasty and creamy, with green banana and herbal infusions. A floral finish shows a touch of bitterness.","73426":"Woody and smelling of sawdust early, this four-grape blend eases toward roasted berry, cassis, herbal plum and molten chocolate. It's massive and structured, with a big-boned skeleton and heat on the leathery, roasted finish due to 15.5% alcohol. Big, fiery, saucy and lusty, but short on refinement and elegance.","73428":"A dark and toasty specimen with a deep-purple tint and aromas of oak, butter and powerful blackberry fruit. The palate is textured and rich, with thick, smoky flavors of black fruits and peppery spice. Pours on the oak but in an integrated way; very good for varietal Cab from 2008.","73545":"Plum and berry aromas are floral and suggestive of perfumed soap. This has a friendly, easy mouthfeel and limited but good flavors of spiced plum and raspberry. A mild, low-tannin finish leaves a peppery aftertaste.","73547":"Opaque purple in color, this extracted, grapy Malbec smells of blackberry, iodine and wood shavings. The palate is lush and fat, with more than enough tannic scrub. Hard, blocky black-fruit flavors give way to an oaky finish with spice notes.","73586":"Cherry and berry aromas are standard and good. Feels a bit edgy and clipped, with slightly herbal red plum flavors accented by a lot of oak and pepper. Turns real spicy and hot on the finish.","73591":"Roasted on the nose, and also a bit flat and stalky smelling. Feels round and simple, with oaky, rustic berry flavors accented by pepper, herbs and tomato. Falls off to basic on the finish, with leafiness. Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot, Malbec and Pinot Noir.","73593":"Opens with wild, foxy aromas that suggest wet animal fur. With time things settle, setting up a plump palate with sweet but fairly bland blackberry and blueberry flavors. Turns hot and woody on the finish.","73594":"Neutral on the nose except for some generic white fruit aromas and saline. Feels tight, linear and driving, with modest apple and vanilla flavors. Turns more barrel-driven and creamy on the finish. Not stellar at this price.","73618":"This single-vineyard Salta Torront\u00e9s is virtually as good as it gets for the variety. Pure lychee, lime and mineral aromas precede a crisp, focused palate. Flavors of steely citrus are chiseled, while the finish is long and juicy. Drink prior to fall 2014.","73624":"Loud on the nose, with big berry aromas, this Cabernet is full and lively in the mouth, with brown sugar, chocolate and cassis flavors. On the finish, it's warm and maintains a chocolaty flavor from before. Overall, this is loaded with ripe cherry, plum and berry fruit, and still it's not a complicated wine.","73641":"This is overtly charred and blackened on the nose, as if it were exposed to maximum-toast oak during the aging process; additional aromas of charred beef and herbs add complexity. This feels choppy and tartaric, with blackberry, cassis, bacon and roasted flavors. A toasty, heavily oaked finish suggests that a few more years of aging will be beneficial. Drink through 2023.","73653":"This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc opens with rustic, untamed earth and leather aromas. On the palate, however, it is more tame and balanced, with ripe, rich depth and cushion. Flavors of blackberry, chocolate and toast finish with simmering heat and chunky weight. Drink through 2021.","73654":"Alluring, attractive aromas of tree bark, licorice, fig and blackberry feed into a layered, concentrated palate with plum, blackberry and peppery flavors. Toasty oak, mild herbal notes and a lot of dark spice drive the finish on this cellar-worthy Cabernet. Drink through 2023.","73663":"Rooty, savory aromas announce this as an atypical high-end Malbec; additional scents of jerky, turned earth, compost and smoke are interesting. In the mouth, this is thick and dense, with flavors of molasses, ketchup, stewed fruits, root beer and fig paste. Befitting a serious Malbec, this finishes long and weighty. Drink through 2020.","73755":"With a nice opening of plum, black cherry, floral notes and mocha, this captures the essence of quality Mendoza Malbec. The palate is generous and round, if a bit warm, and the flavors of blackberry, prune, spice and coffee are what we want from this type of wine. Drink throughout the winter and into 2010.","73770":"Extravagantly floral on the nose, with blueberry, mineral and other particular aromas. But once you hit the palate, the acidity is extreme and thus the mouthfeel is sheering. Flavors of blueberry and mulberry are tangy, while the finish is angular. Too sharp and tangy to compete with the best, including Altamira and Bella Vista, Achaval-Ferrer's other single-vineyard big boys.","73833":"This oak-heavy Syrah from northern Argentina opens with milk chocolate, mint, vanilla and briary berry aromas. The palate is full and chewy, with a creamy, resiny feel and peppery, spicy, herbal blackberry flavors. An oaky, slightly green tasting finish is round in feel.","73918":"Hits the stage with lemon-lime, melon and flowery aromas that are followed by a crisp mouth with jousting acids, lime and tangerine flavors, and finally a crystal-clear finish with zest and length. Very nice for this variety; drink right away.","74304":"More floral and blueberry driven than Bousquet's regular Merlot from '07 but not discernibly better or worse. The palate is round and the balance and feel are good. Flavors of floral blueberry follow the bouquet, and the finish shows a dash of sweet berry syrup and chocolate.","74359":"Mild lemon and apple aromas are compromised by a harsh, stalky element. The mouthfeel is basic and spritzy, while generic apple and green melon flavors end in tropical sweetness.","74367":"Light lemon and melon aromas lead the nose, but the wine slips in the mouth, becoming creamy and flabby in constitution, with only mild citrus, papaya and bitterness for flavors.","74372":"The bouquet on this blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir is stuck in neutral, while flavors of citrus and lemon bend towards sour. The finish is briny and tangy.","74412":"Crisp stony lightly herbal plum aromas are moderately smoky. This feels flush and pleasant, with a full body and flavors of plum, cassis and tomato sauce. A controlled composed finish benefits from lasting acidity.","74460":"Standard apple, lychee and melony aromas lead to a measured, wet and lively palate full of apple cider, citrus and lychee flavors. Modest on the finish, with good acidity and round flavors of apple and melon. Recommended as a basic quaffer.","74547":"Aromas of black fruits, barrel toast and marshmallow set up a palate that's tannic and choppy but full of life. Savory, spicy berry flavors come with chocolaty oak notes prior to a finish that's rough and tannic but true.","74654":"Rough conflicted aromas of horseradish, beets and horse hide lead to a hard grabby palate that feels sticky and tannic. The heavy oak blends with stewed herbal black-fruit flavors before a scratchy tannic finish.","74655":"Rubbery stewy berry aromas give way to a pinched-feeling palate. This tastes of salty roasted plum and it stays that way on a dense, chewy, meaty finish.","74828":"A strong blast of oak comes across as resin and clove, and thus the wood doesn't augment but instead takes away from the fruit. Speaking of fruit, it's jumpy and tangy, with a finish that tastes of green olives. Overall it doesn't show proper balance or full development.","74833":"The Torrontes character shows on the nose, meaning there's detectable lychee and orange blossom scents. The dowside is that the palate is rather thick and honeyed but devoid of flavor. Seems to be fading into the night.","74834":"Light green in color, with standard Torrontes aromas of acacia and tropical fruits. The palate is simple and delivers solid flavors of lychee, melon and green herbs; somewhat cloying and confected.","74838":"Dark, heavy and foresty on the nose, with astringent cherry and coffee flavors. Sharp in terms of feel, with plenty of leftover acidity on the finish. Tartaric acid is all over this wine.","74887":"Soupy, horsey citrus and red-berry aromas precede a flabby palate with herbal red-berry flavors that upon inspection taste both sugary and green.","74902":"Strained, funky aromas of corn chips don't include much fruit. This is mostly acid on the palate, while it tastes raw, choppy and citric. A tart finish fails to rescue this substandard ros\u00e9.","74907":"Dilute cherry aromas are not convincing. Wiry on the palate, this tastes like a mix of berry syrup and tomato. A salty, linear finish turns tart to the point of sour.","74910":"The barn door is open and the horses have left. This is close to DOA, with mushy, weak aromas and flavors, and almost no distinct fruit at any point.","74916":"Rough, grassy aromas and flavors along with a choppy mouthfeel render this one rung above unacceptable. Overall, this is about as raw, punchy, green and herbaceous as a Malbec can get.","75120":"Dark oaky aromas suggest shoe polish and spice, and these scents go well with raisiny berry and cassis notes. A wiry high-acid palate shows strong tannins along with flavors of blackberry, raisin and leather. A wiry, choppy, acidic finish tastes minty and oaky.","75124":"Spicy mossy aromas are cool and herbal, and with that there are grapy, toasty, and chocolaty oak scents. This Malbec blend is tight and rugged, with clampy red-bery flavors resting on that same chocolaty oak. Drying tannins make for a hard finish that should mellow in due time. Drink through 2021.","75127":"Dry focused aromas of spiced apple are fairly classy. This has a bready smooth mouthfeel with substantial malic cut. Full dynamic flavors of nectarine, apple and citrus turn slight bitter before a layered long palate.","75186":"Earthy, rubbery red-berry aromas lead to a hard-drilling palate with fiery cherry flavors and an allotment of herbal mint. The hollow finish leaves a salty flavor and heat.","75196":"Herbal, stalky aromas surround scents of asphalt and animal hide as well as generic berry notes. A lively palate holds flavors of herbal, leafy plum, raw wood and funk, while the finish is tangy in feel, with flavors of dry oak and hints of green.","75197":"Dry, leafy, spicy aromas have a perfumed accent. A pushy, forward-feeling palate houses similar oaky flavors of cherry. On the finish, it turns woody, with resiny flavors and drawing tannins.","75237":"Immediately you know this is heavily oaked because the nose is charred and minty to the max. Airing pushes things toward tobacco and cedar, but it still tastes woody and resiny. Fruit notes of cassis, plum and cherry are spicy, while overall acidity is drawing.","75344":"With little fruit to the nose, this cool-climate Chardonnay smells strained. A chunky palate has a canned-fruit character, tasting faintly of peach and mandarin orange. It lacks freshness, fruit and varietal correctness.","75362":"Charred, smoky, herbal aromas of blackberry trend in the direction of exotic before showing barrel-driven scents of vanilla and clove. This exhibits plenty of depth and sponginess along with toasty, herbal flavors of plum and blackberry. Pepper, burnt toast, clove and blueberry flavors carry the finish on this hefty Malbec; drink through 2021.","75371":"A toasty, leathery, baked-fruit bouquet is sultry and includes hints of popcorn and caramel. In the mouth, this is tannic and full-bodied, with flavors of bacon, hickory smoke, blackened spices and blackberry as the canvas. Minty, dark and oaky on the finish, with heat.","75372":"Rich, heady aromas of black fruits, oaky char and caramel are lusty and modern. In the mouth, this shows a bolt of acidity that creates energy but also strains the wine's balance. Baked blackberry, chocolate, pepper and vanilla flavors finish long, ripe and oaky, with length derived from lasting acidity. Drink through 2021.","75392":"Nice and pure, with controlled berry aromas, a dash of pepper and integrated background oak. A tasty, easy-to-drink wine with fine balance and fresh flavors of cherry, raspberry, cassis, chocolate and a medicinal finish. Good depth, length and size throughout. Delicious Malbec.","75394":"Aromas of sandalwood, violets and berries give this one an elevated, magnetic nose, while the palate is lush, big and full of black fruit and masculine tannins. A dark, minerally style from high-elevation vineyards with a coating of vanilla and caramel on the long finish.","75396":"A fine wine from Septima, most likely with Malbec at its base (though the label says nothing of the sort). Aromas of blackberry, raspberry, perfume, pepper and asphalt are attractive, and the rooty richness and slight medicinality of the core flavors are unique but not out of focus. One of the winery's best wines to date.","75486":"A solid and appealing large-format wine that is 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon. The wine is composed and shows honest aromas of blackberry and cassis. It's juicy and fresh in the mouth, with decent berry fruit but not much in the way of trimmings, i.e. oak, tannins, depth or length. Still, for value hunters it'll get the job done.","75541":"Smoky, earthy and refined on the nose, this Cab is showing a seamless mix of berry and oak-based aromas. Full, moderately tannic, layered and thorough on the palate, this tastes of baked berry fruits, integrated oak and loamy earth. A ripe yet balanced finish indicates that aging is needed. Drink through 2025.","75638":"Aromas of roast plum and earth are a bit nutty and muddled, but overall this is a likable and slick wine with soft tannins and ripe candied-fruit flavors. With lushness and cola on the finish, it ends a bit syrupy and sweet. Good but not what you'd call refined or elevated.","75647":"The Oak Cask in the name is evident in the bacon, vanilla and creamy berry aromas that open things up. The palate, however, is fairly acidic, making the fruit taste bright and feel zesty. Flavors of cherry and plum are distinctly red in character, and the finish is quick and lean.","75652":"A light, mildly stemmy and roasted Pinot with medium body and a solid mouthfeel. While not all that aromatic, the wine tastes of strawberry, raspberry and rhubarb, and there are accents of pepper and herbs along the way and on the finish. Shows good weight and color.","75653":"Cherry and plum aromas carry the mildest touch of stem, yet the palate is reasonably stocky. Cherry and chocolate flavors may seem slightly confected, but given the wine's price it's hard to register many complaints. A creamy and flavorful finish makes this well worth the money.","75799":"Warm and solid, with weight and color. The palate is well rounded and full, with sweet, semisticky berry flavors and a lashing of oak. The finish turns a little herbal and earthy, while the lasting flavors are of vanilla and wood resin.","75849":"Fresh aromas of white gumdrop, quince and peach precede a peachy, citrusy palate. Dry citrus flavors persist on a clean finish. This is a fresh Chardonnay where less is more.","75850":"This cloudy, unfiltered Sauvignon Blanc charts new territory for Argentina. Ripe flavors of peach, pear and melon turn more bitter on the finish, which isn't long due to modest acidity.","75851":"Familiar Cab Franc aromas of dry spice, green herbs, fennel and pepperoni feed into a narrow palate that's high in acidity and drawing. Spiky tomato, plum, herb and pepper flavors finish dry and pulling, with a saucy aftertaste.","75852":"Initial aromas of desert herbs and blackberries lose steam with airing. A flush palate delivers candied cherry and chocolate flavors that carry over to the solid finish.","75853":"A mix of spice, oak, tomato, plum and rubbery aromas announce a palate that blends plump ripeness with pulling tannins. Dry, spicy plum and berry flavors are steady on the finish.","75928":"Cedary oak, tobacco, wood spice and black-fruit aromas are on the heavy side. The palate follows that lead with a chunky bumpy feel. Pushy black-fruit flavors come with chocolate and herbal notes, while this tastes of chocolate mint and feels scratchy and tannic on the finish.","75939":"Dusty apple and peach aromas are mostly pleasant. Chunky and pulpy in feel, this basic Chardonnay tastes of melon and peach. A dry fleshy finish includes a sprinkle of saltiness. Drink now.","76001":"Clean and well made, but underwhelming. There's basic blueberry and blackberry flavors riding on a medium-bodied palate, but overall the wine is more generic than specific. It's easygoing and causes no red flags to go up, however at the end of the day it doesn't show much personality.","76068":"Among Argentinean Chardonnays, Catena's Alta is among the very best. This vintage supplies toasty apple, pear and banana aromas in front of a fresh, full-bodied palate that's clean, pure and Burgundian in character. Flavors of baked apple, oak and spice lead to a long finish. Drink now\u20132014.","76076":"This may be the first time this wine has been labeled Reserve; in the past it was just Finca Sophenia Malbec. And truth be told, it's a good but regular Malbec with berries and raisin on the bouquet, and then juicy berry fruit on the palate. Solidly made, with solid structure.","76205":"Although the bouquet is a touch scratchy, raspberry aromas are good. This feels a little wiry on the palate, with acidity poking through. Flavorwise, there's a mix of generic blackberry and plum, while the finish is lively due to juicy  acidity.","76210":"Although this is almost red in color and entering its twilight, it's not bad for $8. Dusty berry aromas lead to a semifull palate with raspberry, cherry and plum flavors that end in chewy dryness.","76216":"Aromas of matchstick, tropical fruits and stalkiness are a bit challenging. In the mouth, things feel solid and fresh, while flavors of sweet pear, melon, vanilla and apricot settle on mildly bitter come finishing time.","76217":"Here's a basic Malbec with ripe plum aromas topped off by milk chocolate and vanilla notes. It's hard but bold in the mouth, with decent acidity and a forced set of oaky, chocolaty, berry flavors.","76289":"While this is a bit rustic and herbal on first take, with time it settles and improves. Aromas of tomato and berry fruits lead to a crisp, firm palate with earthy plum, black cherry and herbal flavors. A soft fade away with earthy, baked notes doesn't hurt.","76385":"Despite the concept-driven name, this is good Malbec at a good price. Minty black-fruit aromas are welcoming and stand up to scrutiny. The palate has juicy acidity and purity to support plum and cherry flavors that are spicy and dry in nature. For basic Malbec, you won't do much better than this.","76478":"Saturated and pitch black to look at, and not much different in scent. This is a fully extracted, modern Bonarda that's well made and generous. Full-bodied wine lovers should like the meaty, dark berry and cocoa flavors. Tannic but layered on the finish.","76494":"Saturated on the nose, this has aromas of pencil lead, coconut, vanilla and black fruit. It feels tannic, with pulsing acidity pushing raisin, prune, black plum, licorice and graphite flavors. The finish is oaky, resiny and chocolaty tasting.","76525":"Mulchy on the nose, with compost, leather and purple fruit notes. There's decent body to the wine but the flavors are stalky and green, with burnt, stemmy leftovers on the finish. A blend of 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.","76526":"Best on the nose, which is floral as it mixes in big black fruit notes and coconut. The palate has a creamy, grabby feel and then confected flavors of carob, vanilla and baked berry. Finishes heavy and very sweet, i.e. syrupy.","76541":"Pointed, sharp aromas leave an angular bouquet. The rest of the wine is jumpy, furry and a bit funky, with pointed plum and raspberry flavors and then a toasty, oaky finish with bitterness, heat and leftover butter flavors.","76547":"Slightly briny aromas akin to orange peel open this citric PG. Dry orange flavors are more or less it, while this holds steady and stays fresh across a standard finish.","76617":"As far as Argentine Syrah goes, this vintage of Iscay, which contains 3% Viognier in a nod to France, is the new benchmark for the country. Daniel Pi and Joey Tensley's wine discloses aromas of jammy berry fruits along with cardamom and floral notes. The palate is a fortress of layers, while flavors of blackberry, cassis and chocolate set the stage for finishing notes of vanilla, butter, espresso and cocoa powder. Drink through 2018.","76684":"Basic apple and citrus aromas are dusty and straightforward. This feels citrusy and fresh, with little to no oak. Flavors of nectarine, white grapefruit and orange finish firm and fresh.","76687":"Crisp, minerally aromas suggest citrus pith and saltiness. This feels bright and zesty as it dances on the palate. Flavors of tropical fruits, lychee and melon are generic and turn slightly bitter on the finish.","76705":"With its bright pink color and fruity aromas of cherry, strawberry and raspberry, this wine is more good than bad. The palate feels fresh, balanced and juicy, while flavors of plum, cherry and red licorice finish clean.","76709":"Flowery, musky aromas are true to the grape. This is crisp and focused at first, but also wild and foamy. The flavors are a cloud of melon, sweet tropical fruits and grapefruit, while the finish is musky like the nose.","76714":"A rubbery, rustic nose starts out stalky and gritty before settling down. This is closed in feel, with stalky, almost burnt dark-berry flavors that end similarly, with stalky, herbal notes.","76723":"Fleshy and lightly oxidized on the nose, this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay sparkler shows a seltzer-like palate with pulse-preserving acidity. The palate brings a mix of peach, yeast, spent lees and oxidized flavors.","76729":"Peach and generic red-berry aromas take on a weedy component over time. This has a soda-like feel and flavors of yellow beet, mango and candied melon.","76734":"Earthy, woodsy, spicy aromas set up an electric, almost overcharged palate with no finesse. Bright cherry flavors turn peppery as the finish tastes blackened and bitter. Overly lively and unsettled.","76739":"Grassy, herbal aromas contain little fruit, while this feels firm, with no give to the palate. Green, herbal flavors are low on fruit, and this ends with heat and scratchiness.","76922":"Foresty, earthy aromas of leather and black fruits are rugged and a touch rustic. In the mouth, this is voluminous and chewy, with fresh acidity. Flavors of licorice, herbs, pepper, plum and blackberry finish with light herbal notes and bright acidity that will ensure a fairly long lifespan. Drink through 2024.","76953":"This Malbec-Tannat blend from northern Argentina is hard and raisiny on the nose, with ripeness but not much elegance. The palate is rough and tannic, with stewy flavors and raisiny notes. A finish with baked fruit flavors, herbal leanings and leather is classic Cafayate.","76981":"Fresh berry and grapy aromas include hints of violet, Graham Cracker and cr\u00e8me de cassis liqueur. In the mouth, this Malbec from the southern reaches of the Uco Valley feels scratchy, with drying tannins. Lightly herbal, floral blueberry and plum flavors are not what you find every day with Malbec, while the finish is grapy but also shows juicy, wiry acidity. Drink through 2021.","76986":"Ripe bold cassis and blackberry aromas come with notes of fine oak and chocolate. This is thorough and saturated on the palate, with a mix of firm tannins and cushion. Blackened plum and berry flavors have a cola accent, while this is dry, toasty and displays tannic grip on the finish; drink through 2022.","76999":"This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot is powerful, with a blueberry flavor, a mild green note, a balsamic hint and a molasses tinge. It's saturated and clampy in feel, with aggressive flavors of lemony oak, balsamic fruit and baked berry. Warm, oaky and full of licorice flavor on the finish. Drink 2014\u20132019.","77086":"Racy plum and cherry aromas lead to an edgy palate with bold acidity. Crisp, foxy flavors of raspberry and plum finish spicy and with pronounced acidity. This wine emphasizes acidity and freshness over ripeness and heft.","77248":"Charred, roasted, rubbery aromas are low on fruit. Saucy and rough on the palate, this Tempranillo called the \u201cforgotten one\u201d tastes vegetal, meaty, savory and roasted, then stale on the finish.","77249":"Bulky aromas are floral but also suggest lanolin. Malic acidity with a resiny offset is the palate feel, while grainy, pushy oak sits on top of pineapple and apple flavors that dry out on the finish.","77250":"Horsey and raisiny on the nose, which indicates what's coming: that's a chunky palate and a one-note flavor of prune. This is what overripe raw materials can produce.","77257":"This lacking wine smells vaguely like a scented candle. Jangled and citrusy on the palate, this tastes like flower water. An empty finish with nothing but acidity sends it away.","77258":"This is green from front to back. Starting with the nose, this smells like bell pepper and green beans. A raw, scratchy palate confirms where this is headed, and that's toward an underripe palate with a finish that tastes like fresh-picked green beans.","77259":"Herbal berry aromas shift to outright green, horsey and soapy. This has no mouthfeel to speak of, and it tastes weedy and a bit spoiled. A minty, green finish is no savior.","77540":"Very clean, smooth and inviting. Every piece is in place, and the wine flows from nose to palate to finish with ease and comfort. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and blackberry are creamy and deep, with a hint of vanilla sweetness and oak. Warm and chewy as well. Cabernet Sauvignon with 12% Cab Franc; drink now.","77582":"Spicy woody aromas include a note of mushroom. This feels hard and ultratannic, with acidity suggestive of red-wine vinegar. A wiry mix of salt and sour flavors is attached to savory plum fruit, while this pinches down on a drying abrasive finish.","77635":"Surface-level lemon and tropical fruit notes give way to a fresh, clean palate. Powdery, melony flavors of green banana and papaya finish slightly oily and bitter, which is normal for the grape type. Drink immediately.","77741":"Certain Argentine wines have a rustic, foxy character to them that reminds us that winemaking isn't a factory-proven science. This fits the bill; it's murky and sharp on the nose, with brambly raspberry sitting in wait. Feelwise, it's a bit too piercing and choppy.","77742":"The bouquet resembles fresh apple cider. There's more apple and the addition of citrus on the palate, while the finish is ripe, fruity and soft. More chunky than upright.","77749":"Too heavy, murky and pruney on the nose; this wine has a lot of size but little freshness. It's big and bust-out, but with no direction or finesse it comes across earthy and oily. Only 250 cases made.","77893":"An apple aroma comes with a tinge of mild oak, turning fleshy and less fresh with airing. The palate includes flavors of melon, apple and green herb, while the finish is pithy and citrusy, revealing a touch of green onion.","77917":"This reflects the big, modern style of Mendoza Malbec. The bouquet is ripe and hefty, with coconut, mint, blackberry and almond cookie aromas. Expect thick, rugged tannins along with toasty flavors of black coffee, chocolate and mint. A dark, fruity finish is more subtle and harmonious than specific. Drink through 2018.","77963":"Raspberry and plum aromas are woody and narrow in scope. This Cabernet is medium in body but also a bit sticky and resiny. Candied blackberry and black cherry flavors are slightly medicinal, while the finish is oaky, with a lactic flavor and a touch of heat.","78136":"This is opaque, offering a lush collection of black fruit aromas on what amounts to a deep, dense bouquet. Layered and displaying excellent size and texture, it has saturated, meaty black-fruit flavors along with toasty, integrated oak. A powerhouse Malbec and maybe the best Ultra to date.","78143":"This high-class blend of Malbec and Cabernet Franc is both elegant and powerful. The bouquet deals classic Malbec aromas of cola, licorice and blackberry, while the palate features typical Cabernet Franc spice, along with a ripe, healthy blackberry flavor. Expansive and buttery smooth on the finish, this should be opened now\u20132016.","78146":"Opaque purple and thick in the glass, this wine has inky, supercharged aromas of ripe blackberry and spice. It feels amped up but balanced, with more intensity and clarity than what most other $18 reds offer. The flavors of wild berry, mild herb and chocolate finish in a rich, toasty wrapping.","78337":"While the nose on this muscular Malbec is lush, ripe and minty, there's also a grounding, complex scent of graphite. Blazing with intensity, this tastes like a glorious blend of plum, prune, chocolate and caramel. Dry spice, toasty oak and ripe berry flavors touch up against raisiny on the finish. Drink through 2019.","78338":"Take note, this could be the best wine Colom\u00e9 has ever bottled. Cedary oak aromas grace ripe, almost desiccated wild berry notes that are slightly herbal and sauvage. A well-layered mouthfeel is ideal in power and precision. Requisite blackberry, cassis, toast and peppery flavors finish dry and long, with little heat or burn. Drink through 2021.","78378":"Dry, spicy red-fruit aromas are solid and standard, while the palate is lean but comfortable, with dry, simple cherry flavors accented by a spot of oak-driven vanilla. Good but as regular as they come. Easy to drink.","78379":"Generally this is a nice South American Chardonnay. The nose offers touches of apple, pear, peach and light oak, while the palate has bounce, acidity and tangy apricot, nectarine and apple flavors. Finishes lively but dilute, with citrus and lemon peel flavors. Hits the target.","78436":"Compact, concentrated and clean, with all its components in place. The bouquet is dark with charcoal, but bright with berry fruit aromas. The mouthfeel is comfortable and balanced, with sweet berry flavors offset by mild spice and proper oak. Soft tannins define the finish; a fine Malbec that doesn't overdo it.","78464":"Fruity and earthy, with sly, narrow flavors of blackberry and chocolate. This has the ripeness and power that one would expect from a high-end Malbec, but also a bit more finesse and natural \u201credness\u201d than many heavyweights from Argentina. Hints of herbs, pine, lemon peel and mocha grace the structured finish.","78465":"Malbec with 30% Merlot; Numina starts off with dark mineral and crude oil aromas that give way to floral scents before flavors of cherry, blackberry, chocolate and pepper. There's a lot going on and overall this attempt at a high-end, powerful red blend is successful. It's much better balanced than many of Salentein's \u201cbigger\u201d wines, including Primus.","78543":"This is very nice varietal Bonarda. The nose is generic but floral, ripe and full of lifted blackberry and cassis aromas. A rubbery, agile palate carries dark, toasty flavors of blackberry, cassis and chocolate, then a peppery-tasting, toasty finish that manages to not be hot or fierce, which is a plus for this grape.","78548":"A dark, piercing opening with olive, black fruit and mild herbal aromas announces a ripe, full-force Malbec. That impression is confirmed on the full, creamy, jammy palate, where oaky, chocolaty flavors of syrupy blackberry and cooked brown sugar end in a smooth, vanilla-laden finish. Drink now through 2015.","78551":"This opens with dense, earthy aromas of tobacco, coffee grinds and marzipan candy along with blackberry and raisin. The palate feels wide and jammy, with solid tannins that don't bite. A mix of herbal berry, foresty notes and leather comprise the flavor profile, while the finish is gritty, tannic, salty and hard. Give this muscular Malbec plenty of air before drinking.","78555":"This is yet another very good but not quite excellent Malbec from this winery. Solid berry aromas are edged by whiffs of green and horsehide. The palate is fresh, tight and a touch gritty in feel, with leathery red-berry flavors accented by earth and spice notes. This is solid and should be drunk now through 2015.","78594":"Honest Pinot Noir aromas of spicy, leafy cherry and plum are good but common. This feels just about right, albeit a touch full and creamy. Flavors of cola, cherry and chocolate are ripe, moderately oaked and finish creamy, with flavors of vanilla, savory spices and rooty sweetness.","78598":"Smoky, spicy aromas are highly wood-driven, which creates hickory and campfire scents rather than discernible fruit. This feels a touch sticky and soupy, while baked, woody berry, black plum and cassis flavors are charred prior to a spicy, chunky finish.","78608":"Aromas of almond and apple don't show much sizzle or snap. This blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Sauvignon Blanc is round and soft in feel, with slightly cidery flavors of apricot and apple. Drink now.","78646":"Black as they come, with saturated, jammy aromas of sweet berry fruit, blackberry syrup and toasty oak. The palate is lush and chewy, with black fruit, spice and herbal flavors. Toasty and black on the finish. A big wine with plentiful oak as well as purity.","78647":"Bulky and dark up front, with coconut, ripe berry and heat on the nose. Feels rich and resiny, with sticky tannins, extract galore and flavors of coconut, wood grain, black licorice and sweet blackberry. Finishes hefty and grabby, with wayward oak that needs to settle in.","78648":"Sweet on the bouquet, with aromas of coffee, mocha, berry jam and cherry extract. Broad and saturated on the palate, with ripe blackberry, cassis and chocolaty flavors. Finishes smooth and easy, with ripe tannins. Very nice but ordinary as full-bodied, extracted Malbecs go.","78655":"Like most Tikal wines, this is beefy and saturated, with grapy, creamy, dark fruit aromas. Feels tight and lush in the mouth, with a meaty structure and dense flavors of blackberry and herbs. Turns more herbal as it unwinds before finishing toasty and thick.","78657":"Rubbery smelling at first, then earthy cherry and stewed fruit aromas emerge. Juicy and a bit pointed in terms of acidity, so it shocks the palate and pierces the cheeks. Tastes pulsing and ripe, with big red fruit flavors, candied sweetness, coconut and chocolate.","78661":"This new Pinot from Laura Catena's Luca label is fresh, honest and peppy. The nose is lightweight, airy and a little earthy, while the palate is fresh and agile, with good acidity and nice raspberry and pie cherry flavors. Shows some oak, vanilla and spice on a dry, mild finish. Definitely on the right path.","78711":"Gentle scents of perfume, wild berry and cedar blend seamlessly on the nose. The palate is more punchy and tight, with heavy extraction creating narrow flavors of blackberry and cassis. A short, sinewy finish limits the wine's breadth.","78713":"For Cab Franc, this is super ripe, with floral, perfumed, earthy aromas of cassis and wild berries blended with pastry and vanilla. In the mouth, it's big but balanced, with loamy, slightly salty flavors of baked black fruits. A lasting ripe-fruit character carries onto the finish.","78727":"Heavy oak scents create a popcorn nose that leads to flabby flavors of peach and melon. The wine is woody and simple.","78728":"Berry aromas come in front of a sharp, plummy palate. This tastes herbal, spicy and woody, with dry berry flavors that turn tangy, edgy and oaky on the finish.","78823":"Prune, raisin and gamy black-fruit aromas fold in a note of iodine. This Uco Valley Malbec features tough but manageable tannins in front of a savory tasting palate with roasted plum and berry flavors. A note of salt lends complexity to a rubbery, tannic finish. Drink through 2023.","78835":"Jammy blackberry and boysenberry aromas are on the rich side. At 15.5%, this is SuperUco's biggest wine, and while it's heavy on the palate, with grapy, peppery blackberry flavors, it hides its weight and alcohol well. On the finish, intense black-fruit and salt-tinged flavors are powerful but balanced. Drink through 2022.","78948":"Baked plum and berry aromas are earthy, savory and a touch cheesy but not overdone. This Cabernet is more heavy and syrupy than lean. Flavors of lemony oak, brown sugar and baked berry fruits finish with fig and chocolate accents. Drink this ripe, full-bodied wine over the next couple of years.","79008":"Grassy, lightly weedy aromas set up a palate with sweet citrus and melony flavors. This is sticky and a touch mealy come finishing time, with a fleshy, unctuous feel and only modest structure and acidity.","79013":"Spice and smoky oak aromas blend with perfumed berry scents and candy in front of an astringent palate with plum, cherry and smoky aftertones. Dark, minty flavors on the finish are matched by hard, rubbery tannins. Time in bottle could be a benefit.","79018":"Dark plum and berry aromas are given a wild side from juniper and pine notes. This feels grabby in the mouth, with prune and hickory flavors bringing a backing of smoke and clove. A toasty, hot finish feels muscular and rubbery.","79026":"Nutty aromas of almond skins and walnut aren't terribly fruity but show some mineral cut. The wine is punchy but standard in feel, with a mix of citrus and melon flavors. The finish tastes nutty and a bit briny.","79079":"Bright berry aromas are comported and good. Feels driving and forward, because of its bold acidity and choppy tannins, but tastes nice and dark, with blackberry and cassis flavors. There's a controlled burn to the finish, and overall the wine seems healthy.","79085":"Forceful from the opening, with floral notes, dark oak, shoe polish and char vying with black fruit aromas. Feels both lush and tough, with hard tannins poking through. Tastes of black fruits, cola and heavily toasted oak. Bittersweet on the finish; lusty and black but neither elegant nor light on its feet.","79128":"Nothing more than cherry soda aromas to get it going. It's highly confected, with decent acidity its only saving grace.","79129":"Angular and overcrowded with rhubarb aromas and flavors. There isn't any finesse to this wine and only a modicum of acceptable fruit and body. Tart at the core.","79132":"Full and overly chunky, but ultimately off-kilter. Too sweet and gummy.","79136":"Strangely colored, with oyster shell aromas and weird orange-influenced flavors. Not exactly sweet but not dry either, this is borderline wine made from Cabernet and Malbec. Imported by North American Beverage Group.","79161":"Far less ripe and appealing than the 2004 version. The '05 comes out of the chute smelling malty and lactic; airing reveals strawberry milk notes, while the flavors struggle to express themselves. Sticky, oily and as if someone hit the mute button along the way. Where's the ripe, lush quality we've come to love about Argentinean Malbec?","79181":"Aromas of commercial soap, cherry and crushed stone are candied, pushy and not easy. A choppy mouthfeel with shrill acidity is another tough road to travel. Flavors of cherry cough drop and coffee are hot prior to an abrupt hard-driving finish. Elegance is not a factor in this fruity bullish Italian-style blend of Malbec and Corvina.","79194":"Aromas of tangerine and bath oil are a bit soapy. This feels citric and lean. Flavors of lemon and green apple are slightly bitter on a finish that ends with a tired note of spent yeast. Drink immediately; this is starting to fade.","79249":"Compact aromas of red berries get a boost from oak-based coconut, cedar and graphite notes. This is a blend of three Malbec vineyards of varying elevations; it's bursting with acidity, while high-toned plum and currant flavors are a touch salty. A lively, fiery finish is fueled by latent acidity. Drink through 2020.","79253":"This is an unusual, exotic take on Malbec. The bouquet delivers cardamom, sandalwood and spiced black currant aromas. In the mouth, it's grabby with pinching tannins. Blueberry and cardamom flavors end ripe, with decent follow through. Drink now.","79274":"This is a clean, non-oily Torront\u00e9s with tropical-fruit aromas. A balanced palate propels lychee, citrus and melon flavors toward a slightly chunky palate. This aromatic wine is in the heart of its quality window; drink immediately.","79373":"Hints of rubber, iodine and graphite accent concentrated blackberry aromas in front of a chewy, pruny palate. Flavors of rubber and herbs share the stage with prune and raisin, while the finish is rich and plodding, with depth but limited complexity. Drink through 2018.","79479":"A typically huge Colom\u00e9 wine with initial damp, murky, funky aromas that give way to earth, roasted fruit and compost. Fortunately it's fresher in the mouth, and the wine definitely improves with airing. Still, the palate is big and oily, with roasted berry, herb and wild, exotic flavors. A unique style of Malbec from old Calchaqu\u00ed vines.","79511":"IThe nose is all prune and dessicated berry, while the palate is low on acid and feels heavy. Flavors of baked berry and raisin finish the same.","79526":"Ripe, almost earthy aromas of plum, Graham cracker and pastry precede a rubbery palate with squeaky tannins. The palate delivers a bolt of black currant and spicy plum flavors in front of a fiery finish that loses fruit quickly.","79604":"Violet in color, this has ample berry and cassis notes on the bouquet. It feels edgy and grabby, with oaky, spicy plum and blackberry flavors. The fruit component fades fast on the finish, leaving a dry, peppery aftertaste.","79655":"With floral aromas, toasty oak notes and solid berry fruit, this bottling is the best among Trapiche's 2007 single-vineyard Malbecs. The palate features smoky berry fruit but also high acidity and some scour. Fortunately it's also layered and structured. Will do best with meats and fatty foods. Drink now through 2015.","79661":"Potent smelling, with black pepper, lots of oak and true berry fruit aromas. The palate is a bit pointed and high in acidity, while the flavors of raspberry, currants and red plum are solid. Finishes a little jagged and acidic, but at worst that staunch acidity will keep it alive for years to come. Hold until at least 2011.","79812":"Inky dark-fruit aromas are blanketed by oaky scents that settle on caramel and vanilla. This four-grape blend of Bordeaux varieties is both creamy and acidic, with herbal notes along with spice, wild berry and leafy flavors. Snappy, crisp acidity hangs around on the finish, creating a racy sensation. Drink through 2018.","79870":"Jumpy berry aromas, animal fur and candied scents are less than refined. This is fresh but not that structured in the mouth, with herbal berry flavors and a lightly green-tasting finish that's scratchy in feel.","79922":"This scents of citrus peel and lime, with a plump, oily and round palate that features orange and banana flavors. A blend of 75% Chardonnay and 25% Viognier, it turns melony on the short finish.","79937":"A little murky and muddled on the nose, this has rubbery tannins and candied, foxy-tasting berry flavors. Nothing harsh or sour here, but it is tannic; at best, it's sweet and simple stuff.","79982":"Starts out earthy and gaseous but the bouquet settles on round, full blackberry aromas. Lush, grabby and full in the mouth, with bold blackberry flavors that are clean, forward, uncomplicated and even a bit elegant. Tastes good and comes across smooth and polished for Bonarda.","80014":"This has briary, herbal aromas and a sweet beet note. It is syrupy and sappy, with candied cassis and black cherry flavors.","80104":"Blackberry and animal aromas precede a rubbery, tannic, full-bodied palate. This rugged, black-colored Malbec pumps out big blackberry flavors in front of a chocolaty but short finish with emerging oak.","80136":"Plum and berry aromas are mild and a bit metallic. A drawing, grapy mouthfeel and generic but solid flavors of blackberry and blueberry finish with a touch of oak. This doesn't have a ton of character, but it's balanced and tasty.","80180":"Saturated raisiny aromas include notes of clove and nutmeg. This is huge and also tartaric in feel. Baked raisiny flavors are chocolaty, while savory, leathery notes add complexity to a hard, tannic finish.","80181":"Wiry aromas of berry fruits settle upon airing to show a more earthy and toasty side. This Malbec feels chewy and fat, with oak resin making things grabby. Flavors of hickory and oak grain outmuscle generic black-fruit notes, while this suggests beef jerky on a cured-tasting finish.","80191":"This might be the only commercial Trousseau from Argentina, and it's rusty in color, with translucence. Savory challenging aromas of orange peel and burnt orange include notes of dried cherry and fallen leaves. A tightly knit palate is home to flavors of dried cherry and plum as well as tomato sauce. A hint of maple vies with dried red-fruit flavors on a light finish that shows some elegance.","80207":"High-toned floral and tropical aromas are vivacious. A racy palate with bold acidity is the stage for lychee and flowery flavors. A full finish with bitter edges is true and textbook for Salta Torront\u00e9s.","80346":"Heavy oak aromas are dominant in this wine. Drawing in feel and showing a high level of tartaric acid on the palate, this tastes woody and resiny, with blackberry flavors ending on menthol and heat.","80354":"Scratchy aromas of raspberry and licorice gumdrop precede a grabby, sticky palate with raw tannins. Plum and berry flavors are standard for Malbec, while the finish shows a mild baked character.","80364":"Leathery berry aromas are balky and dusty. Hard, dry and tannic on the palate, this shows blackberry flavors followed by dry, bitter notes. A simmering finish says this badly needs food.","80409":"Chewing gum dust, red plum and cherry aromas define the bouquet on this racy, slightly abrasive feeling Malbec. Things taste short and snappy, with red fruit flavors backed by peppery dryness.","80412":"There's a fine line between ripe and overripe, and this awkwardly toes that line with syrupy aromas and a sticky mouthfeel. Along the path are flavors of maple, fudge and stewed blackberry. A jammy, soupy, candied finish is apropos for a heavy, superripe wine such as this.","80423":"Dry oak, pepper and wood resin are prominent on the bouquet, which also brings minty black fruit scents and finally a pinch of sawdust. The palate is boosted by firm acids and tannins, while the flavors of baked berry and black plum are driving. A lot of oak and bite here, but also plenty of dark fruit.","80430":"Smoky and leathery on the nose, with earthy blackberry aromas, tobacco and tree bark aromas. The palate runs sort of heavy, tannic and raw, with grapey flavors of black currant and roasted plum. A chunky, earthy, roasted style of Cab to drink now.","80633":"Loamy, rich aromas of blackberry, licorice and chocolate cake come before a bold, balanced palate with acidic kick. Loamy blackberry, prune and licorice flavors finish with jammy richness and lingering flavors of blackberry, chocolate and anise. Drink through 2020.","80643":"Fleshy, herbal black-fruit aromas include mild leafy notes. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Ancellotta and Caladoc is intense in feel, with chewy depth and mild tannins. Meaty, baked flavors of boysenberry and blackberry finish solid, with creaminess and herbal notes. Drink through 2020.","80687":"Consistent with prior vintages, this Malbec is a full-throttle wine with huge aromas of blackberry and cassis. This version is a bit more narrow and linear than in the past, but it's still excellent. Flavors of oak-based vanilla and coconut sit on top of vivacious berry fruit, while chocolate cake and coconut are the key flavors on a large, lusty finish. Drink through 2018.","80866":"Meaty aromas suggest baked berry, prune and other ripe fruits. The palate is almost soupy in its richness, while flavors of molasses, berry and toast are ripe and concentrated. A roasted-tasting finish features notes of cooked brown sugar.","80907":"This ripe, charred, dark-as-night Malbec captures the lush essence of Argentina at its finest. Deep aromas of licorice, blackberry, coffee and toast set up a full, layered palate, with vanilla, baking spice, black plum and blackberry flavors. A lusty finish with licorice, mocha and tobacco notes is generous and dandy. Drink through 2023.","80968":"Fairly large, dark and extracted, but also lush and rich, with aromas of raisin and stewed blackberry. The palate is rich to the point of almost being heavy, while the flavors of blackberry and roasted black plum are mildly leathery and salty. Nice, big, meaty and tasty for the price.","80977":"Baked and compact on the nose, which is dark, rubbery and offers hints of smoked meats. The palate has a rich, layered feel and robust flavors of baked black fruits, molasses, caramel and toast. It's warm, full and shows Old World notes of tobacco and toffee. Drink now.","80994":"Mango, papaya and vanilla aromas are lightly tropical and chunky. The palate is plump and fair. Flavors of green melon, papaya and mixed tropical fruits finish steady and with a reprise of leesy, yeasty vanilla.","81022":"Strawberry and herbal aromas are decent but a bit green. This has a jammy feel, with basic berry flavors that finish minty but fresh. Overall, this is a middle-of-the-road Malbec.","81051":"Immediately this clicks. The nose is full of ripe, smooth blackberry and molasses aromas, while the palate is chewy, layered and loaded with meaty blackberry, dark spice and coffee flavors. This is an excellent value Cabernet.","81061":"After tasting a number of underwhelming San Huberto Malbecs, this high-end offering changes things up. It's piercing and serious up front, with rubber and black-fruit aromas. Although it clamps down due to hard tannins, there's enough body, oak, black-fruit flavor and vanilla to carry it through to a long finish. It's by far the best wine from this label I've tried. Drink through 2017.","81077":"Smoky cherry and earth aromas are the opening salvo on this bullish yet well-made wine. Expect a full mouthfeel that wraps itself around toasty, creamy flavors of chocolaty plum and spiced tea. Barda excels on its lively finish, which is long, properly acidic and spicy tasting.","81131":"Cidery apple aromas, a medium-bodied citrusy palate and tart flavors of tangerine end with citrus aftertones. This is about as basic as drinkable Sauvignon Blanc gets.","81448":"Big and forward but still elegant, which is what we like. Spice and bold black fruit carry the bouquet, which leads straight to a smooth palate flush with berry, plum and cola flavors. Finishes like glass, meaning it's super smooth. A voluptuous but balanced wine, with only the slightest hint of syrup. Drink now.","81454":"Expect a fair amount of forward, creamy oak and you'll be just fine digging into this rich, healthy Malbec (with some Cabernet Franc). Intense blackberry, black cherry and chocolate flavors bring a smile even if they don't seem that complex. But on further thought, this wine is about hedonistic richness, barrel notes and pleasure as opposed to stirring things up intellectually.","81455":"Lush, forward and complete, with a full mix of sweet and spicy aromas leading to bright berry flavors accented by licorice and vanilla from well-managed oak. Salentein is making better wines now than ever before, and this toasty, warming number is a prized bull that can only help Argentinean Malbec preserve its good name.","81480":"Initial cherry and violet aromas take on more herbal, green and grassy scents as the bouquet expands. In the mouth, this hits hard, while baked, spicy flavors of herbal plum and berry finish leafy and stewed, with carob and toast. As a whole, this is typical of Salta Malbec.","81537":"Dominating aromas of clove and baking spices are forced and oak-based, and thus not natural. In the mouth, this lusty, extracted Malbec feels raw and choppy, with rough tannins. Flavors of clove, savory berry fruits and green herbs continue on the finish.","81643":"Modest black cherry and berry aromas are earthy and a touch flat. This is a full-bodied Malbec with baked blackberry as the lead flavor and oaky, savory, saucy side notes. Residual dark-berry flavors and chewy tannins drive the finish.","81644":"Bold, gritty, balsamic berry aromas are rubbery and saucy in nature. Edgy and grating on the palate, but also full of spunk, this tastes salty. Modest red-berry flavors finish oaky and rustic, with a lasting note of aged balsamic vinegar.","81866":"This earthy, stewy blend of Malbec and Cabernet is classic Salta, and even more particular to D\u00e1valos, the producer. Soupy aromas give way to a lush, chewy palate with edgy acidity. Saucy, roasted, salty berry flavors finish meaty and baked in character. Drink through 2020.","81882":"Typical varietal aromas of lychee, citrus and white flowers feed into a juicy palate that's tight and tangy in feel. Lychee, pineapple and mango flavors hold form on the finish before showing a slight bit of pith and bitterness at the end. Drink now.","81895":"Big, stacked, deep and dark Malbec. The nose is rich, spicy and black in character, while the palate is bulky and shows generous blackberry, dark plum and chocolate flavors. Holds steady on the finish as it delivers muscle as well as some complexity. Well-made wine for the money.","82016":"This almost translucent brick-colored Pinot offers aromas of lettuce leaf, orange peel and dried red fruits. It's light, edgy and fresh in feel, with flavors of salted meat and herbal plum. A tangy citric finish is primed with racy acidity. Fermented and aged in egg-shaped cement tanks.","82104":"Dense berry aromas are muscular but low on complexity, meaning this is more big and bulky up front than elegant. Chewy, wide and bullish, with drawing tannins and snappy acidity, this delivers baked plum and raisin flavors. It finishes with fig and spice notes along with chewy tannins. Drink through 2017.","82179":"Fragrant lemon-lime and exotic bath soap aromas lead this wine. A round, oily feeling palate is full for the variety, with flavors of mixed citrus fruits, honey and lychee. Potent acidity creates some burn on the finish.","82190":"Charred, almost burnt aromas dominate the nose on this muscular, tannic Malbec. Like the nose, this tastes largely of blackened hickory and coffee, meaning the fruit is buried under a lot of barrel weight. Drink through 2027.","82199":"Raisiny berry, spice cake and molasses aromas are rich and heady. This nonvintage blend of Malbec and Petit Verdot is a bit thick and oaky on the palate. Flavors of blackberry and creamy oak finish ripe and rooty, with a reprise of raisin.","82377":"This bulky bullish Malbec opens with big tarry aromas that go heavy on the oak. The palate is tannic like the clack-clack of heels on a tile floor. This tastes earthy, oaky and like blackberry, while the finish echoes with those same flavors. Drink through 2023.","82378":"Dry spicy aromas accent woodsy berry scents. A tight focused palate jabs with acidity and poking tannins, while this tastes of lightly herbal cherry and berry fruit. Spicy flavors on a healthy finish help this along.","82400":"Piercing aromas of char and creosote are like a laser pop surrounded by a note of blackberry. This is raw, tannic and hard on the palate. Chunky berry flavors are heavily oaked, while this is jammy in feel and tastes of blueberry on the finish. Drink through 2021.","82428":"Ripe blackberry and plum aromas are open and potent. Strong tannins make for a rough palate feel, while dry, pulling raspberry and plum flavors finish with burn and a woody character.","82549":"From Familia Bressia, this Brut Nature smells like a cross between a frosted doughnut and dried tropical fruits. In the mouth, this is citric in feel, with tart, almost sour flavors of orange along with the peel. A tangy citric finish ends with lingering grapefruit and orange notes.","82564":"This copper-colored ros\u00e9 is based on 85% Pinot Gris and 15% Syrah. It smells of dried apricot and cantaloupe, while the palate feels fleshy and round. Moderately complex flavors of salt water and stone fruits finish full.","82565":"Jammy blackberry and raisiny aromas come with hints of herbs and tomato in front of a medium-bodied palate that's choppy and tannic. Blackberry flavors with a pinch of bitterness on the side finish loose, with wayward focus.","82566":"Inky in color, with exotic, gaseous and balsamic aromas of black fruits and iodine, this biodynamic Malbec-Syrah blend is funky, jumpy, tartatic and jumbled on the palate. Stew, somewhat sour and earthy berry flavors finish scratchy but with length and energy.","82574":"Aromas of briary berries mixed with tomato leaf set up a compact bumpy palate. Saucy herbal tomatoey berry flavors are commonplace, while overall this is energetic and likable.","82791":"Green, grassy and not very appealing. There's a can't-miss murky, green, herbal character here that yields almost weedy fruit flavors and carob. Sweet, candied, green and just not that good for a Paul Hobbs-made wine.","82797":"Yellow and chunky, and definitely on the way toward the grave. Mustardy aromas are severely short on freshness, and the palate is just as flat, dull and mealy as the nose. A weird, low-acid blend of Chardonnay, Viognier and Chenin Blanc.","82803":"If the color doesn't tell the full story, the nose will: it's impeccably perfumed, round and sweet, with amazing fruit aromas and a toasty background. The feel is as lush and rich as they come, and there's outstanding purity to the lusty black fruit flavors. A masher with elegance. Maybe the best Malbec Argentina has ever produced. Drink from 2011\u201315.","82820":"Bold berry, leather and rubbery aromas show a minerally side. This is a big Malbec-driven blend with nice layering and structure. The flavor profile features reduced, roasted black-fruit flavors along with hints of herbs and leaf. The finish is generally smooth and long, with a pinch of heat. Drink through 2017.","82898":"This is lightly perfumed with green melon, lychee and papaya aromas. The palate is middle of the road in terms of acidity and snap. Flavors of lychee, peach and nectarine are typical of the variety, while the finish is plump and smooth.","82909":"Raspberry and plum aromas start with a resiny oak covering that turns foresty and briary with airing. This is raisiny and ripe in feel, with a complex mix of berry, fennel and anise flavors. A lush, dense-feeling finish is minty and herbal.","82967":"Heavily oaked up front, this smells of sweet spices, lactic berry fruits and hickory. The palate is fairly blocky and grabby, with resiny wood notes. Flavors of hickory and lactic berry match the nose on this oaky rendition of Malbec.","82969":"Roasted, soupy berry aromas lead to a sticky, heavy palate with a doughy build. This tastes mostly of baked, herbal tomato and plum, while cherry, spice, chocolate, coffee grinds and earthy flavors bring up the rear.","82983":"Spicy, stalky, roasted plum and berry aromas are savory and earthy. In terms of feel, this is big but has its shirt tucked in. The flavors, however, are herbal and almost weedy. This gets more difficult the longer it sits; by the time it finishes it's outright funky, herbal, medicinal and earthy all wrapped into one.","82994":"Familiar varietal aromas of lychee and scented candle come with a hint of petrol. Punchy and crisp in feel, this tastes of garden variety lemon-lime, banana and lychee. A crisp but rudimentary finish closes things out.","83039":"This uniquely tan-colored Torront\u00e9s is \u201corange\u201d in style. Aromas of orange peel, peach, apricot and floor polish are challenging but complex. This immediately turns grabby and astringent on the palate, while stone-fruit and pithy flavors are short, quick and dry.","83043":"Aromas of prune, raisin and black plum are full and gritty. A chunky full-bodied palate feels grabby, while this tastes of generic blackberry, burnt coffee and dark chocolate. A steady plump, rubbery finish closes the show.","83047":"Exotic berry and spice aromas are reserved, as the name of the wine implies. On the palate, this is blocky, heavy and jammy. Concentrated flavors of plum and currant are a bit stewed and tomatoey. On the finish, this is dense and tannic, with savory stewy flavors.","83116":"Tropical and citrus fruit aromas come with controlled skin-based bitterness. This has a full oily texture and flavors of lemon-lime and white pineapple. Fresh acidity on the finish keeps this clean and in good shape. Drink right away.","83195":"Compact, concentrated aromas of licorice, wild brush, fresh herbs, lemon peel and cassis come in front of a high-acid, juicy, racy palate. Flavors of black plum, blackberry, herbs and pepper finish spicy, woody and with some unresolved heat. Drink through 2024.","83201":"El Limo (silt) is solid on the nose, with blackberry, licorice and vanilla aromas. This is fresh on the surface but more layered below deck, with a crisp, healthy mouthfeel backed by berry, plum, raspberry and peppery chocolate flavors. On the finish, this is oaky and round, with some heat and burn at the tail end. Drink through 2021.","83204":"Black cherry and medicinal aromas dominate an earthy, dense nose. A ton of energy is unloaded on a grabby, aggressive palate that's packed with cherry, plum and cough drop flavors. This is ripe, forward and fresh, with brown-sugar sweetness to the finish. Drink through 2024.","83278":"Jammy berry and cassis aromas come with a bit of leather and horse hide. This brings it on the palate, but there isn't much finesse to the mix of blackberry and baked plum flavors along with hard tannins. Give this time in the glass and it opens up and mellows out.","83357":"Immediately appealing, this trendsetting Malbec proudly cranks out blackberry and spice aromas that are on the spot. Full and tannic on the palate, but not too fierce, this tastes of bold, earthy plum and black raspberry with savory notes kicking in. A long, tightly wound finish with well-integrated oak means this will last. Drink through 2022.","83533":"A more than solid wine cut from the tropical, South American blueprint. It's open and full of banana, pear and apple aromas, and while it runs hot and fast on the palate, it's got lots of woody, ripe flavors of apple and pithy citrus. Round, lively and packed with flavor even if it shows almost nothing in common with cool-climate Chardonnay.","83537":"Nicely done and not the least bit difficult or complicated. The nose is full of bold black fruit and balsam wood, while the palate is full and stocky, but balanced. Flavors of berry and cherry are forward and sticky rich, while the finish is long and shows just enough acidity to keep things focused.","83538":"Five grapes led by Malbec make up this full-force wine with black cherry, cough syrup, vanilla and cream on the nose. The palate is rich, creamy and heavy, with deep, saturated black fruit and chocolate flavors, while the finish is just as thick, maybe thicker. Extremely ripe and saturated, what many would call a \u201cfruit bomb.\u201d","83539":"Smooth, mellow, chunky, sweet and heavily oaked. It's a modern New World Chard in every way; the palate is full, chunky and sweet, with flavors of spiced apple and tropical fruits including banana. Vanilla and cream carry the finish, and overall this is well made and rich but unctuous.","83563":"Gotta hand it to Trivento, Concha y Toro's Argentine operation: their wines are consistent from year to year. Once again, the Select Chardonnay features a smooth, buttery nose and a well-oaked but healthy palate. It's woody for sure, but there's lemony balance. We wouldn't call this stately or great, but it gets the job done at $11.","83709":"Cola, black cherry and lemony grit mark the bouquet, which is backed by acid-driven, lightly lemony flavors of cherry and raspberry. There's isn't a ton of volume, depth or follow-through to this wine; it is what it is: fresh, tangy and straightforward.","83720":"A chunky wine with a full, round, sweet, tropical outlook. The nose settles on pineapple chunks, while the creamy palate features flavors of baked yellow apple and melon. Finishes upright, which is better than many. Not sophisticated but still good for Argentina.","83727":"Candied, tutti-frutti aromas give this a sweet, somewhat faux bouquet with little concentration. But the palate is chewy and grabby enough, with solid but modest raspberry and red plum flavors. Mellow on the finish, with a decent feel. Good but not distinguished. Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.","83730":"Good for Argentine Chard but not worth the price. It starts with mellow peach and apricot aromas, which are followed by melon, papaya and banana flavors. Easygoing in terms of feel, with a creamy, sweet finish. A typical South American tropical Chardonnay.","83747":"Very light in color and body, with citric and chewing gum aromas along with a spot of caramel. The palate is lean, jumpy and fresh, with tart cherry and plum skin flavors. Borders on sour but doesn't quite go that far. Lean Pinot any way you slice it.","83754":"This extracted, oaky wine is generous on the nose, with minerally notes, iodine and potent blackberry aromas. It's big but balanced, and the flavor profile delivers common berry, toast and oaky flavors that finish strong and with espresso-like bitterness.","83785":"Rich, jammy black-fruit aromas come with plenty of wood, char and campfire-related grit. The palate is chunky and a bit soft, with prune, raisin, baked plum and herbal flavors, especially on the finish, which feels plump, loamy and fully ripe.","83815":"Leather and earth aromas are just part of the meaty, roasted, lightly charred bouquet. The palate is thick and jammy, with savory, roasted flavors of berry fruit, pepper and leather. Finishes with chocolate and a fine texture. Impressive despite having a light herbal streak. 500 cases made.","84058":"Raw herbal spicy aromas come with a heavy draping of savory oak. This Bonarda feels full, rustic and a touch creamy. Dry spicy barrel-heavy flavors outweigh fruit on this oaky smoky red wine.","84198":"Raisiny berry aromas come with notes of spice cake and green herbs. This wine feels narrow, hard and gritty. Uncommon flavors of fennel, licorice and bitter chocolate are as prominent if not more so than blueberry and black-plum fruit. The wine is louder and more demanding on the palate than on the finish.","84436":"By Belasco de Baquedano, this is a chunky, low-acid Malbec with mint, raisin and slightly damp, earthy undertones. The palate is weighty almost to the point of syrupy, while the flavors are of cola and sweet berries. Soft and slightly herbal, but good in a no-fuss sort of way.","84479":"Raisin and molasses aromas and flavors are a big part of this full-bodied, syrupy number from Cafayate in Salta. Additional scents of licorice, herbs and reedy berry only add to an overbearing sense of ripeness. In the mouth, this is heavy, with weighty tannins. Flavors of prune and P.X. Sherry precede coffee, chocolate and fig flavors on the finish.","84553":"Initially this Malbec-led blend is reduced, but with airing minerality and concentrated aromas of jammy berry fruits and latex win out. This is packed, ripe and stacked on the palate. Flavors of ripe black fruits, licorice, pepper and berry preserves finish spicy, peppery and with a note of chocolate. Drink through 2020.","84627":"Aromas of wild flowers, honey, lychee and oily citrus fruits announce a minerally palate with steely yet tropical flavors of citrus and lychee. This is better cut than most, with racy acidity that keeps things running on the finish. Drink now.","84752":"Ripe black-plum aromas veer towards prune without fully going there. A full chewy palate holds blackberry and plum flavors, while this finishes oaky and lightly herbal. Overall, this captures much of what's good about Mendoza Malbec.","84753":"Dark berry and cassis aromas precede a focused chewy palate. Blackberry, blueberry, chocolate and spice flavors come together well, while a chunky full finish is ripe and satisfying.","84760":"Aromas of freshly cut wood, pencil eraser and spice crowd out berry scents. Choppy grating tannins make for a firm mouthfeel, while flavors of savory spices and briary black fruits finish oaky, with residual scratchy tannins. Give this plenty of air for it to show its best.","84765":"Ripe blackberry and cassis aromas show a note of graphite. In the mouth, this Cab is rocky and hard, with crusty cheek-sucking tannins. Herb-infused black-fruit flavors of cassis and blackberry finish oaky, chocolaty and minty, with biting, hard tannins.","84807":"Oaky and ripe up front, this offers graphite, inky berry and cedary aromas. A plump, full-tannin palate has flavors of black cherry, plum and cassis along with integrated spice notes. It's woody, tannic and demanding on the finish.","84811":"Dark, concentrated, mildly charred aromas of black plum and blackberry are toasty, strong and minerally. Following the nose, this Malbec is chewy, extracted and fairly rich. Blackberry is the lead fruit flavor, backed up by a lot of oak and vanilla.","84836":"Waves of berry aromas matched by oak-based vanilla and a hint of violet comprise the nose on this Malbec-led blend that smacks hard in the mouth with tannic bite and acidity. Flavors of wild berry, cherry and hard spices finish juicy and lively. Drink through 2018.","84951":"Aromas of matchstick, crushed vitamin and white fruits feed into a lean, hollow palate with surface-level oak. Lemon and oak are the key flavors, while this tastes oaky but feels rather watery on a light finish.","84968":"Aromas of herbal black fruits and road tar are crisp and gritty. This is pulling and a bit raw in feel, while foxy herbal currant and black-plum flavors finish lively, with residual flavors of oak and clove.","84991":"Purple in color, with ripe, meaty, earthy aromas mixed with herbs, exotic berry fruit scents and vanilla. This is feisty and full-bodied Pinot with integrated plum, blueberry and well-applied oak. It's a little more citrusy and zesty than in previous vintages, and definitely a heavier style than its Cincuenta y Cinco counterpart, which will allow it to age for another four to seven years.","85911":"Slightly dry and scratchy on the nose, and definitely fully oaked in the Toso style. But once it settles deeper, black fruit notes escape. The palate is snappy and juicy due to 2008's cool harvest conditions, and the flavors are a mix of plum, berry and woodiness. Long and oaky on the finish; drink now through 2013.","85926":"Cola and minty, herbal aromas come with raw oak and gritty, baked berry scents. This is rugged, tannic and grabby on the palate, with heavy wood resin flavors heaped atop blackberry and plum. Woodspice and heat drive the finish.","85948":"Tight and rubbery at first, but with time it settles to show jammy wild-berry aromas and density. The palate has bounce and life to spare, while the flavors are bright, fruity and full. A serious Malbec with a bit of hit and scratch to the finish. Drink now into 2012.","85958":"Another fine wine from this unheralded producer. Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot weave a nice picture based on sweet raisin, coconut and chocolate aromas. The palate is tannic but generous, with flavors of prune, blackberry, chocolate and tobacco. Chubby, rich and ripe, with intensity and darkness throughout.","85961":"Chunky, ripe and fruity, with bacon and roasted berry aromas. The palate has a good feel and tannins that melt away, while the flavors of black cherry and cassis lean toward medicinal but don't fully go there. Bold like Malbec should be, with hints of rubber and latex on the finish.","85969":"Warm dark fruit aromas of blueberry are accented by rubber and earth. The palate is deep and racy, with no dead weight and good flavors of berry, cassis, spice and chocolate. Bright in feel, focused and just oaky and dry enough to not be jammy and soft. 35,000 cases made.","86255":"A touch foxy and reduced on the nose, with jumpy berry aromas, this feels edgy and shows a grating tannic bite. The wine's plum, herb and candied berry flavors are solid, finishing with a dose of blueberry.","86386":"Firm and focused berry aromas set up a full, weighty palate with dry tannins. Flavors of lightly herbal plum and berry are more generic and clean than special, while on the finish this feels smooth and tastes dark and fruity.","86466":"Roasted dark fruit aromas form a generic opening, while the palate is perfectly acceptable even with some scratchiness. The flavors are your basic berries and pepper, while the finish is dry and toasty. Good but regular, plain and simple.","86490":"Smoky aromas of graphite, road tar and wild berry set up a wiry, full-force palate with a can't-miss beam of tartaric acidity. Blackberry and chocolaty flavors finish forward, with unabashed freshness and drive. Drink through 2019.","86492":"This is quintessential Argentine Malbec. Aromas of roasted black fruits and smoke transition to a toasty, oaky palate with a spectrum of flavors ranging from herbal to jammy berry. In between are notes of tobacco, spice and molasses. Drink now through 2018.","86508":"Hulking, oaky aromas include spice, sandalwood and loads of ripe black fruit. This is massive in the mouth but sturdy and not overbearing. Flavors of baked berry and cassis are meaty, while the finish offers up licorice, spice and tons of density and concentration. Drink through 2019.","86541":"This classy Cabernet marks a high point for Salentein. On the nose, it's redolent of oak grain, tobacco, vanilla and all sorts of berry fruits. The palate is full, ripe and solid as an ox. Spiced berry, tobacco and cedary flavors finish dry, sturdy and lightly herbal. Drink through 2022.","86544":"Dry oak, black fruit and floral notes suggestive of violet are the aromas that set off this tannic, clamping, deeply structured Malbec. Flavors of mocha, maple, savory blackberry and roasted plum end with a mix of creaminess and strapping tannins. Drink through 2025.","86904":"Grainy oak and green aromas rest on top of generic red-fruit scents. This feels chunky, blocky and tannic, with herbaceous medicinal flavors of tomato, oak resin and green herbs. A spicy saucy-tasting finish holds onto the wine's minty green herbal essence.","86913":"Scratchy raspberry aromas are jammy but also green, with a strange hint of perfume. This feels chunky and rubbery, with stretchy, elastic tannins. Flavors of baked berry fruits, prune and herbs finish hot.","86915":"Big, raisiny and obtuse up front, this fully extracted Malbec is heavy on the palate, with raisin, prune and cassis flavors that show interior notes of green herbs. This tastes minty, herbal and hot on the finish, with barely any freshness.","86916":"Soupy, saucy aromas are akin to tomato sauce. This is wide, chunky and struggling for textural balance. Stalky roasted plum flavors finish herbal, spicy and flabby in feel.","86919":"This wine has showed no consistency over the years. This vintage is black and extracted with piercing inky blackberry aromas. In the mouth, it's huge, chunky and grating. Overdone black-fruit flavors finish clampy with oaky bitterness and a sense of reduction.","87069":"Rooty, earthy berry aromas include a hint of clove. This feels full and chewy, with broad shoulders and firm tannins. Herbal blackberry flavors come with tea and spice notes. It is stocky and woody on a finish that tastes like campfire smoke.","87071":"Black-fruit aromas come with notes of fresh-cut grass, rose petal and berry jam. The mouthfeel is creamy and sticky, with modest acidity. Ripe, rich flavors of berry fruits, cocoa and caramel finish jammy. Drink this tasty, saturated, soft-bodied Malbec through 2018.","87122":"On one hand this is a bulldozer blend that's all about black fruit and heft. On the other, it's fun, fruity and generous, with plump tannins and a luscious mouthfeel. Flavors of blackberry are dark, oaky and spicy, while the finish is regular in feel and toasty. A ripe, big, friendly blend of 70% Malbec with Tempranillo, Syrah and Petit Verdot.","87337":"A heady but attractive bouquet of marzipan, balsam wood, blackberry, cassis and raisin introduce a loaded but well-balanced, full-bodied palate. Toast, chocolate and black fruit flavors finish with additional spice, chocolate and lustiness. Drink through 2019.","87340":"Revancha is a new line of wines from esteemed winemaker Roberto de la Mota. This blends Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cab Franc. On the nose, it is spicy, lightly herbal and deep in fruit. A tight palate shows raw tannins and flavors of wild berry and oak-based coconut. Dry, flashy and a bit rough on the finish, this will benefit from a few more years in bottle. Drink through 2020.","87382":"Gritty berry aromas are solid but a bit underwhelming for a wine of this price. Heavy, sticky and tannic on the palate, this tastes of herbal berry fruits and a ton of oak. That woodiness reverberates on the finish via maple, resin and toast flavors, while hard tannins make this more about power than finesse. Drink through 2025.","87434":"Sweet yet simple aromas of milk chocolate, candied cherry and vanilla set up a fair and balanced palate with oak, medicinal and raw red-fruit flavors. A slightly hot, semisweet finish is just good enough.","87455":"Earthy, spicy aromas of juniper, bell pepper and oak cover up slightly underripe berry scents. This has an acceptable level of tannic scratch and peppery, herbal berry fruit flavors. Like the rest of this Cab, the finish is lightly herbal, green-leaning and hard.","87470":"If you're into big Argentinean Malbecs with great fruit, oak and balance, look no further. This is exact and pointy on the nose, with graphite and spice notes framing huge blackberry aromas. Deep but well balanced, this muscular Malbec tastes of chocolate, peppercorn, fine oak and black fruits. A smooth, toasty finish is bold, with a touch of unresolved heat. Drink through 2022.","87474":"Ripe, loamy aromas of raisin and prune include notes of coconut and chocolate. Full and rugged on the palate, this Malbec-Cabernet combo tastes fully ripe and dark, with immense blackberry and prune flavors. Fig, prune and cassis notes grace a finish that's flush with chocolate and unbridled richness. Drink through 2024.","87476":"This Malbec-led blend contains 20% Syrah, but it's the Malbec that drives it. Crisp, toasty aromas of graphite, lemony oak and blackberry are tight and not at all lazy. A massive palate is choppy, with rugged tannins. Baked black-fruit flavors of cassis, mocha, tobacco and chocolate end long and loamy, with unbroken concentration. Drink through 2025.","87722":"Oak aromas ride high on a ripe, smoky nose that's pumped full of black-fruit scents. This is a chewy, dense style of Cabernet with thick, rubbery tannins. Baked blackberry, resiny oak, spice and herbal flavors finish long, with roasted notes and lasting, chewy tannins.","87726":"Melony, tropical aromas are clean and holding steady. This is on the full and oily side, with citric acidity creating a centerweight. Punchy citrus, melon and peach flavors finish with a light, pithy bitterness. Drink now.","87730":"Scratchy but fresh blackberry and plum aromas properly announce a direct, juicy palate with straightforward plum and cherry flavors. This is a thoroughly likeable blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon that shows mild oak on a light, easy finish.","87813":"Dense to the eye, then fully oaked and extracted on the nose, this beefy Malbec smells like coconut and blackberry. The palate is the same: jammy and extracted. Meaty berry flavors are heaped with a ton of oak, while the finish is syrupy and mighty tannic. Drink through 2020.","87836":"Earthy, roasted blackberry, leather and animal aromas are draped all over this Malbec blend. A palate with drawing tannins and firm acidity frames flavors of baked black fruits, toasty oak and char. A tight finish delivers additional toast and smoke flavors along with licorice and blackberry notes. Drink through 2021.","87842":"This muscular Malbec opens with a blast of ripe berry aromas offset by oaky coconut notes. A plump palate avoids being pudgy, while plum, black cherry and blackberry flavors end with a turn of oaky vanilla and balancing residual acidity.","87879":"Fiery, foxy and leathery on the bouquet, with a hint of latex in addition to ripe blackberry aromas. Feels round and fresh, with a complete mix of plum, berry and currant flavors. Finishes tight and legit, with good length and feel.","88042":"Its borderline weedy aromas are abrasive. This has a drawn-in tannic palate with citrusy acidity. Briary herbal berry and red-plum flavors are green in the middle, while this is unyielding and herbal tasting on the finish.","88144":"Light, dilute aromas of raspberry and cranberry come with a sweet accent of red-licorice rope. This feels sticky but shallow, while the flavors are candied. A gritty, somewhat bitter tasting and tannic finish is the closing act.","88150":"Charred, leathery aromas include popcorn and black fruits. This is angular and high in acidity, while the flavors run salty and rubbery, with black-fruit notes. A strained, lightly herbal finish tastes like roasted tomato.","88152":"Peach and white-flower aromas forecast a fleshy, soft palate. Papaya and melon flavors are honeyed, but this finishes bland, with a vanilla note.","88157":"This Torront\u00e9s is fading. After aromas of air freshener and lychee, the wine feels heavy and clampy, with an oily character. Its tropical flavors are unimpressive, while the finish is round in feel but bitter in taste. Better to wait for the 2012, or even the 2013, to come around.","88224":"Heady, high-class aromas of kirsch, balsamic-soaked blackberry and licorice get this off to a great start. At this stage, this is intense and restricted, but concentrated in a promising way. Toasty black-fruit flavors welcome coffee and chocolate accents on the finish. Give this powerful Cab Franc time; best 2018\u20132027.","88352":"Rubbery and scratchy smelling on first take, with fiery berry aromas lurking below. After it airs out the wine is juicy and solid, with good balance and dark, spicy flavors of black fruits and chocolate. Tannic and steady on the finish.","88354":"Earthy up front, with roasted, smoky berry aromas and herbal accents. Feels good, with tomato, red plum, leaf, herb and oaky flavors. Turns more juicy and rugged as it opens, with a light green character to the finish.","88363":"Light and clean, which compared to other Argentine Pinot Grigios is not something to dismiss. Feels solid and punchy, with orange and mango flavors. Has nice overall clarity and balance, with a citrusy finish.","88434":"Part of the fun of exploring Argentine Malbec is tasting all the new kids on the block. Having not seen Guentota before, all signs point to high quality. The bouquet is dark, with accents of cola, mineral and burnt toast giving it a masculine edge. Round, plump and full in the mouth, with cherry, berry and cassis flavors. A total package of a wine, with character, nuance and serious base-level fruit.","88615":"Tangerine aromas lose clarity the longer this sits. The palate is full but acidic, which creates tartness on a flavor profile that revolves around pithy citrus, particularly orange. A chalky finish is lively but tastes a bit sour.","88616":"Deep, rubbery black-fruit aromas suggest prune and cassis along with blackened spices and toasty oak. The wine is flush and bursting with fruit and herbal notes. Cassis and berry flavors settle with blackened toast and menthol. Drink this Bordeaux-style blend through 2019.","88652":"Jammy, soft blueberry aromas are a touch green. This is syrupy, heavy and sticky on the palate, with chocolate, prune and peppery flavors. Tannic and heavy on the finish, this is an overweight Malbec that's lush to the point of being fat.","88698":"This well-oaked Cab opens with reedy berry scents along with notes of lemon peel, coconut, tobacco and black currant. A narrow palate evaporates into a pool of snappy acidity, while short, choppy, citric flavors of red plum and currant end with oaky vanilla but even more wiry acidity. Drink through 2019.","88770":"This is a heavy wine with an earthy, almost stewed-smelling nose that is defined by raisin and prune aromas. It feels grabby on the palate, with chunky, blocky berry and prune flavors. This musclebound Malbec finishes rubbery and ripe.","88789":"Dilute, oddball aromas of blueberry and currant are rendered earthy and less than fully clean by a whiff of compost. This feels basic and jammy, while floral berry flavors settle on herbal and peppery. It finishes lean.","88798":"Wiry, rugged aromas of cassis and blackberry are a bit green and pyrazinic. Chunky, tannic and sticky in feel, this tastes of baked black fruits. Stewy, syrupy and creamy on the finish, the wine gets better the longer it sits.","88810":"Opens with blackberry aromas, earth and spice notes. There's a shock of core acidity to the palate that keeps the wine fresh and balanced. Flavors of black cherry and black currant are jammy and on the sweet side, and the finish has a cookie dough quality along with lasting sweetness.","88876":"Spicy, herbal plum and berry aromas are a bit rubbery and offer a sweet hint of cinnamon powder. This is deep and ripe on the palate, with rooty flavors of blackberry, fig and baking spices. Lasting rooty nuances blend with cocoa notes and mild heat on the finish.","88881":"Lychee and lemon-lime aromas come straight from the Torront\u00e9s textbook. This is plump and round but still fresh in feel, with peach, pear and melony flavors that finish a bit short and oily, but with a note of white flowers. Drink now.","88882":"Rooty aromas of licorice, leather and blackberry improve with airing. This shows hard tannins and a grabby palate along with rooty, herbal flavors of blackberry and dark plum that finish with blackened spice notes, licorice root flavors and lively acidity.","88909":"This is a real blaster of a Malbec, showing power, concentration and subtleties. The bouquet is full of graham cracker, cola, monster berry and moss notes, while the pure, driving palate deals flavors of toasty blackberry, spice, mocha and more. The lengthy but mellow finish hums like a fine-tuned machine. Drink now\u20132018.","88915":"This smells as deep as an ocean trench, with mint, cola, blackberry and toast aromas all rolled into a tight bomb that's ready to explode. It feels balanced yet densely concentrated, with wild berry, tobacco, savory spice and even a mild saucy component. This finishes smooth, with integrated leather, herb and berry flavors. Drink any time over the next 5\u20136 years.","88926":"This small-production Malbec is superb. The bouquet smells mossy, earthy, dense and loaded with smooth berry aromas. It's lush, deep and well balanced on the palate, with powerful black-fruit flavors along with fudge, tobacco and cola notes. The feel, flavors and length are all top quality. Drink now\u20132018; only 230 cases were made.","88969":"Pithy green fruit aromas are short but within normal parameters for the variety. Feels a bit heavy, with a baNAa influence. Flavors of soft citrus and melon are middling, while the finish is weighty.","88970":"Brambly smelling, with tomato, green herb and rhubarb aromas. Nervy and tight in the mouth, with minty, spicy flavors that keep any fruit character in the distance. Scratchy and tannic as well.","89076":"This Cabernet Franc is superripe and oaky, with earthy, stewed and woody aromas. In the mouth, this feels grippy, resiny and dense. As it airs out, vanilla, woodspice, prune and cassis aromas come to the fore. The chocolate-tinged finish is slightly sticky in feel, exuding a strong sense of ripeness.","89125":"An oily white-fruit aroma is overrun by a heavy oak scent, leaving notes of resin and toast on the bouquet. The wine feels fleshy, and the palate keeps that theme going with baked flavors of apple and peach. This is about as oaky as a wine can be and still be very good.","89144":"This wine is herbal, prickly and roasted, singing the Salta tune of oddness and earthiness. It feels medium to full in the mouth, with a roasted dark-berry flavor and plenty of herb and pimiento tones. Finishes deep but salty, with notes of roasted red pepper and stew. A blend of 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon.","89170":"Warm, rich aromas of wild berry carry a hint of dried cheese, while the rest of the bouquet is woodsy and spicy. The palate is juicy with fresh acidity, and the flavors of red plum and raspberry are solid. A structured wine with good DNA. Drink now through 2011.","89213":"This Malbec blend is ripe and woodsy, with cedary boysenberry and cassis aromas that are spicy and include some barnyard. A full, hammering palate is tanninc and grating. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and vanilla finish on both sides of the line that divides elegance from rugged intensity. Drink through 2024.","89223":"Ripe, toasty, smoky aromas of blackberry, cassis, licorice and prune are gritty. This is big, tannic and blocky, with tartaric scrape. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, raw oak, licorice and spice finish with notes of toast, chocolate and baking spices. Drink this full-bodied, jammy blend of Malbec and four other red grapes through 2020.","89230":"Crisp, toasty aromas of black cherry and cassis are impressive. This is a full-bodied Malbec with edgy tannins that stop short of being hard. Berry, chocolate and woodspice flavors finish smooth, long and complex, with a welcome note of cedar. Drink through 2020.","89310":"This is not your average power-packed Malbec. Opening scents of meaty, wild berry fruits are feral and interesting, and also quite bold. A layered, deep palate shows purity, black-fruit flavors and oaky additions of chocolate, spice and pepper. A dark, minty, spicy finish is fiery, so drink cautiously through 2023.","89324":"Expensive Malbec, but there's no denying its quality and class. The bouquet is super smooth and silky, but also powerful. And that pretty much describes the palate: beautiful berry fruit rides a wave of richness that comes with accents of vanilla and pepper. Sexy, alluring wine with character.","89411":"Full berry aromas with spice on the side form a good opening. It's a full, tight wine on the palate with oaky, meaty, almost foresty flavors of blackberry, spice and mint. Racy, drying, tasty and good given that one finds few Syrah-Bonarda blends to pick from.","89417":"Dense, meaty and lightly herbal on the nose, with minty berry notes. The palate is firm and issues tannic crack in front of plum, herbal flavors, brown sugar and vanilla. Turns mildly hot and grating on the finish, with juicy length. Good for everyday Malbec.","89431":"With clean citrus and tropical aromas as well as a touch of almond skins, this is nice on the bouquet. On the palate, it's round feeling and citrusy, with weighty peach and citrus flavors that hollow out on the finish.","89439":"This is a good but decidedly herbal-leaning Cab. The nose gives off tomato, spice and light berry aromas. It's fresh and medium in heft, with more herb and spice flavors than black fruit. Things turn woody, spicy, dry and slightly hot on the finish.","89441":"While the nose is toasted, raw and spicy, the palate is weighty and legit, with grabby tannins and generic but solid flavors of mixed berries, herbal notes and oak. The finish is savory and slightly barbecued in flavor.","89452":"Chunky, slightly rubbery aromas revolve around black fruits and oak. This is a dense, thick wine with blackberry, plum, fig and bitter chocolate flavors. The finish is dark and weighty in this meaty Malbec.","89456":"This wonderful under-$20 Malbec opens with a blast of black-fruit aromas as well as mild rubber scents and minerality. The palate is solid, with baked berry and integrated saline and mineral flavors. A bright, lively finish with a ton of berry essence closes this out.","89463":"Smoky aromas of bacon mix with tobacco, graphite and earthy berry scents. Offering a big, tannic mouthfeel, the wine has flavors of fig, tobacco and mature berry fruits. The finish is long and firm. Drink through 2017.","89470":"Plum and raspberry aromas are wiry in nature and \u201cred\u201d in character. The wine feels healthy and not overly heavy, with roasted, slightly herbal flavors of berry fruits and creamy oak. A spicy, lightly herbal finish ends this Malbec-Syrah-Merlot blend in solid fashion. Drink through 2015.","89492":"Lagarde regularly makes consistent, true wines and this Cab is compact, solid and smooth, with spice and a lot of berry fruit on the nose. Refined, deep and pure on the palate, with blackberry, marzipan and licorice flavors. Very nice Argentine Cabernet for the money. Drink now into 2011.","89806":"Grapy aromas of berry fruits and the dust of spearmint gum set up a loud, high-acid, seemingly electrified palate that tastes of black currant, blackberry and plum. Overall, this is a linear feeling Bordeaux blend with bracing acidity and minty oak. Time should only help it along. Drink through 2022.","89812":"Briny notes of oyster shell blend with spicy barrel notes and core apple aromas on the bouquet of this crisp, pure, minerally Chardonnay. Flavors of apple, quince, orange marmalade and minerals finish sturdy and secure.","89818":"Strong blackberry aromas come with hints of wood smoke, graphite and minerality. On the palate, it is high in acidity and a touch scouring, but also fresh and lively. Common blackberry and toasty oak flavors end fresh and crisp, but short.","89833":"This Malbec-led blend opens with inky, hard-packed aromas of black fruits and grilled meats. The palate is on the rough and tough side, while flavors of ripe black fruits are intertwined with strong oak and spice. Overall, this is ripe, bold and heavy.","89941":"Mossy and inky in smell, this has a firm palate. Flavors of berry, herb and chocolate set up a dry finish, with structure and background complexities. Spicy and herbal, it has a Chilean sort of character.","90141":"Intense on the nose, this has spice, leather and ripe berry aromas. It feels clean, plummy, juicy and bright, with lifted red and black fruit flavors. Showing chewy tannins and additional juiciness on the finish, it's very nice and delivers the goods.","90188":"Oaky aromas of sandalwood and spice accent dark-berry scents. This feels full, tannic and drawing, but not rough. Woody roasted plum and blackberry flavors remain oaky on a finish that includes vanilla notes.","90189":"Earthy notes of compost and murk blend with oak and black-fruit aromas to form the nose. While this feels a bit spiky and high in tartaric acidity, flavors of vanilla and berry fruits are good. A finish with plum-based flavors, overt oak and scratchy acidity is par for the course.","90206":"Round, superripe aromas of earthy black plum come in front of a tannic palate. Earthy baked-cherry and black-plum flavors finish with licorice root and baking spice notes along with gripping tannins. Drink through 2019.","90210":"Earthy compost accents berry and root-beer aromas. This Salta Malbec gives a lush false impression before wiry, jumpy acidity takes over the palate. Across the flavor profile, berry and plum are amplified by tartaric acidity, while on the finish this doesn't settle down much. Drink through 2023.","90241":"This is one of the top Malbecs from Neuqu\u00e9n and it's under $20. The bouquet is focused, dark and loaded with inky berry aromas and graphite. The palate is deep and layered, and full bodied, with blackberry, chocolate and coffee flavors. A long, spicy, toasty finish is warming but not hot. Drink through 2017.","90244":"Furry berry and minty oak aromas are forced. This Cabernet-Malbec blend is saturated and intense to the point of being hard. Medicinal plum and berry flavors are basic, while a peppery shot of oaky mint returns on the finish.","90251":"Raw, reedy aromas of currant and cherry lead to a rubbery, pinched palate. Cherry and berry flavors are generic, as is the finish, which has hints of brown sugar. The blend is Merlot, Bonarda and Malbec.","90258":"Dusty white-fruit aromas are generic. This fuller-bodied Chenin Blanc tastes of apple and acid-driven salt and brine.","90259":"Dilute yet raisiny aromas struggle to stir interest. This wine feels wide and flat on the palate, with no real focal point. Chunky, slightly bitter flavors of apple skins and wood spice finish with a blast of oaky clove.","90266":"Earthy, mulchy berry aromas lack freshness and clarity. This is a dense, meaty, thick Malbec with stewed black-plum and woodspice flavors. Used tea bag and baked berry flavors show on the finish.","90277":"Lightly stewed, tomatoey aromas belie how angular and acidic this Malbec is. Sharp is the word that best describes the mouthfeel, while tart plum and currant flavors finish with drawing acidity.","90348":"Tropical fruit aromas are suggestive of bath soap and body oil. This feels obtuse, with depth and an oily sensation to the palate. Chunky, ripe, oily flavors of melon and orange finish loud and ripe, with a deeper set of tropical fruit flavors than your average Argentine Torront\u00e9s.","90360":"Floral berry and plum aromas are touched up by notes of thyme and cardamom. Fresh grippy acidity keeps this lively, while flavors of berry and plum are spicy and suggestive of tomato sauce. Saucy, herbal flavors rise up on a high-acid finish.","90460":"Solid dark-berry aromas are dense and deep. This has a plump forward fruity palate with concentrated, toasty flavors of blackberry and dark plum. On the finish, this remains fruity and compact, with more than enough body weight.","90552":"Deep, compact and rich on the nose, with a big dose of ripe berry aromas. The palate is healthy and blends a beefy, muscular body with balancing acids and firm but ripe tannins. Tastes pretty and sweet, like blackberry or plum pie. Chewy and chocolaty on the finish; overall it's a winner.","90555":"Argento has found its calling with this wine, by far the best to date from this label. It's deep and pure, with raisin, blackberry, spice and vanilla on the nose. Super solid and lush, with layered flavors of jammy berry, coffee and chocolate. Holds all its form on the finish; excellent vino for the dollar.","90562":"Condensed and dark on the bouquet, with initial hard, cheesy aromas giving way to herbal berry scents that suggest thyme and rosemary. The palate is soft and chubby, with just enough structure to make the earthy, ripe berry flavors taste better than simply big and bulky. Finishes with a light espresso bitterness. Drink now through 2012.","90638":"Ripe, rooty aromas of licorice, leather and peanut are matched by cedar, tobacco and other complex scents. This mature Cafayate classic is still rugged and solid on the palate despite showing a rusting color. Flavors of chocolate, prune and baking spices finish deep, with rooty, chocolaty notes and pent-up energy. Drink now.","90752":"This opaque Malbec weighs in heavy, with fully ripe aromas of jammy blackberry, raisin and baking spices. A gigantic palate is packed with lemony acidity and resiny oak. Flavors of blackberry, prune and cassis come with chocolaty richness. The finish is rugged and hard, with massive tannins. Drink through 2022.","90753":"Bold center-cut oak aromas are lemony and resiny, while notes of coconut and vanilla are present along with cassis and plum scents. A saturated palate is full of power and energy. Flavors are heavily oak influenced, meaning mocha and coffee notes are as prominent as plum and berry fruit. Drink this serious Malbec through 2023.","90761":"Tight, rooty, spicy aromas of cherry and cassis include notes of raw minerals and crushed rocks. This is a bit gritty and tannic, but it's not fierce or unyielding. Reedy, spicy plum, berry, coffee and cocoa flavors finish dry, with lasting notes of chocolate and baking spices. Drink through 2021.","90763":"Ripe, loamy blackberry, prune and cassis aromas lead to a structured palate that boasts big, firm tannins. This offers dark, ripe flavors of wild berry, black plum and chocolate prior to a toasty finish that's largely subtle and smooth. Drink through 2021.","90767":"Aromas of balsam wood, blackberry, asphalt, leather and peppercorn combine into a complex and appealing whole. This is big and tannic, but with snappy acidity, it's harmonious. Blackberry, cassis and boysenberry flavors show chocolaty richness, while a moderately hot finish keeps things going in the right direction; drink through 2020.","90784":"A very rich and soft wine made from hand-squeezed Malbec grapes. There's a ton of oak on it, which comes out as coconut and cream on the nose. The palate is also creamy, with mocha, sweet blackberry and fudge flavors. Cola, coconut, coffee and other hedonistic, dark, masculine accents make this a fun and interesting wine to drink now. Best on its own or with meat.","90793":"Here's a full-of-dynamite, small-batch Malbec that smells of bold berry fruit mixed with earth, smoked meats and mocha. The flavor set is pure, driving blackberry with mild herbal accents, and the finish is long, flavorful and lightly herbal. Expensive and a little fiery, but still excellent. Drink now through 2013. Only 250 cases made.","90846":"This is a mild, neutral Torront\u00e9s with yeasty notes and hints of tropical fruits. The palate is smooth but simple, while flavors of melon and green papaya finish with lingering lychee notes. Overall this is plump, fresh and good.","90939":"Herbal berry aromas suggest density, and this is certainly dark full-sized and sticky. Pumped-up candied black-fruit flavors are thick and gooey, with cooked brown sugar, mint and toast flavors on the finish.","90945":"Muddy plum and berry aromas lead to a sharp, rugged palate. Tart plum and pie cherry flavors end raw, rough and bitter.","90948":"Odd aromas of bath soap and tropical fruits are not convincing for Chardonnay. A narrow diluted palate offers low-level lemon and tropical-fruit flavors in front of a sour underwhelming finish.","90949":"Aromas of spearmint gum along with a weird coating of oak create a challenging nose. This is high in acidity, to the point of feeling shearing. Sour herbal plum flavors finish rough and bracing.","90952":"Cidery, citric and jumbled on the nose and palate, this is barely cutting it. Briny, limited flavors of mealy citrus fruits finish flat.","90974":"Torront\u00e9s is not known for aging well in the bottle, and this one is almost past its prime. There's some tropicality left on the nose, but it mostly smells sweaty. Flabby on the palate, with an oily, bitter peach-pit flavor.","91101":"Tomato, red bell pepper, plum and currant aromas have a slightly sharp, varietal-related minty, green angle. This feels round and creamy on the tongue, with good acidity propping up flavors of baked berries, spice, chocolate, raw oak and vanilla. A medium-length finish with baking spice flavors confirms the wine's power.","91107":"An interesting wine that walks to the beat of its own drum. Organic wines are almost always a little unusual, and this is no different. It pours on the funky red-fruit aromas and then come herbal cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. As a whole it's a good, well-made wine with decent feel. But hailing from La Rioja, it also has its own unfamiliar identity. Worth a try if organic wines are your thing.","91115":"Red in color, and definitely smelling and tasting like Malbec. And while you want to like it more, there are some glaring flaws here, namely a weak bead that turns it flat. Furthermore, there's rhubarby sourness at the core. Has its moments but needs more work.","91119":"There's more rhubarb and bramble here than we prefer from a young, everyday Malbec, and thus the bouquet is austere and only skin deep. As might be expected given the aromas, the palate is limited to herbal, lightly pickled red fruit, while the finish is quick and offers some lasting chocolate. Decent wine, but that's as far as it goes.","91164":"Exotic, earthy aromas of loamy blackberry, pencil eraser, brown sugar and violet petals lead to a deep but wiry and clipped-feeling palate. The flavor profile is oaky, with spiced berry and cardamom notes leading the charge. A lasting finish is stern and doesn't waver. Drink through 2020.","91211":"A touch stemmy and cooked smelling, with Cafayate's patented herbal notes. The palate has a regular feel and briary, herbal flavors of pepper, tobacco and red berry fruit. Spicy and warm on the finish, but good in a competent way.","91251":"Alta Vista's single-vineyard series consistently consists of winning wines. This version is compact, with intense aromas of plum and boysenberry along with a whiff of orange peel. The palate is tight with tannins. Flavors of blackberry, toast and licorice finish sturdy and long, with juicy acidity adding length. Drink through 2019.","91276":"Soupy tomato, plum and green tobacco aromas feed into a pinched biting rubbery palate. This Merlot tastes roasted and oaky, with baked plum and berry flavors matched by clove and chocolate notes. A drawing tannic finish tastes stewy and woody.","91398":"This blend of 70% Malbec with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Syrah is woody and smoky up front, with aromas of raw oak, char, shoe polish, blackberry and cassis. The longer it breathes, the better it gets, with black-fruit, baking spice and licorice flavors leading the way to a rich but short finish. Drink through 2019.","91404":"This very ripe, jammy blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Syrah smells rich and concentrated. In the mouth, however, it's syrupy and low in acidity, while flavors of cassis and blueberry push up against candied before finishing dense and extremely ripe. Drink now through 2019.","91442":"Mossy, balsamic aromas of baked berry fruits and root beer are soft and friendly. In the mouth, this is chunky and fairly tannic, with no glaring holes. Rooty flavors of baked berries and mocha finish with molasses and root beer notes.","91451":"Floral blue-fruit aromas suggest juniper and moss. This feels heavy and low on acidity. Crazy, unique flavors of tea, prune, pepper and hoisin sauce finish minty, mossy and herbal, while the lasting feel is grapy.","91468":"The bringing together of Malbec and Tempranillo works like a charm here. There's a touch of complexity to the fruit-forward nose, and better depth than what most under-$10 red varietals offer. Look for sweet, smooth raspberry and plum flavors with a tasty, balanced finish.","91469":"Bold blackberry and cola aromas work the nose on this bold, muscular Malbec-Syrah blend. But just when your expectations are at their highest, the palate doesn't quite meet expectations with its angular acidity and sharp-edged feel. The fruit is here, and with it the aromas and flavors. But moutfeel and balance are thin and piercing.","91472":"Aromas of baked plum, spice and bramble give it a sweet-savory opening. The palate is a touch scratchy but also endowed with tasty raspberry, plum and spice flavors. All totaled it's slightly heavy and probing, yet the burnt caramel, chocolate and dark fruit on the finish seem right for the wine.","91486":"An improvement over the dull, mulchy 2005; this wine is still a little earthy, heavy and gaseous out of the bottle but with airing it offers ripe strawberry and plum flavors with licorice and tree-bark accents. Solid, a bit tannic and slightly resiny from barrel aging; but it's also a legitimate Pinot Noir with some elevated qualities.","91631":"Basic black-plum aromas are as good as it gets. This is showing too much acid and not nearly enough stuffing to support it. Scratchy pie cherry and raspberry flavors finish raw and rugged.","91633":"Grassy, herbal aromas contain little fruit, while this feels firm, with no give to the palate. Green, herbal flavors are low on fruit, and this ends with heat and scratchiness.","91634":"Musky aromas of lychee and orange are easy to peg as Torront\u00e9s. On the palate, there's zest and acid but not much substance. Tangy and tropical in flavors, and shallow in body, this is just o.k. Includes 5% Malbec for color.","91645":"Rubber, animal and herbal aromas control the nose on this strained blend of Malbec and 30% Corvina. The palate is drying and crisp, with rugged tannins, while flavors of stalky red-berry fruits, bacon and rubber finish with heat and bitterness.","91649":"Simple apple and apricot aromas prevail on the nose. This feels lean, shallow and hollow, while flavors of peach pit and melon are somewhat bitter and finish abruptly.","91655":"Musky orange and grapefruit aromas include asparagus and bell pepper scents. This is flat in feel, with mostly vegetal flavors of asparagus and green bean.","91656":"Herbal aromas of tomato, spice and red plum are a fair announcement of what's to come, namely a sharp, acidic palate with sizzling plum and raspberry flavors. Blazing acidity and little body make for a long, tart finish.","91693":"Earthy aromas of Boston baked beans and stewed berry fruits set up a stout, dense, ripe palate. This wine tastes of baked berries and cassis. A finish with spice-cake flavors feels dense and meaty, with a savory aftertaste.","91717":"Raisiny berry, spice cake and molasses aromas are rich and heady. This nonvintage blend of Malbec and Petit Verdot is a bit thick and oaky on the palate. Flavors of blackberry and creamy oak finish ripe and rooty, with a reprise of raisin.","91722":"This smells heavily charred, like a blend of burnt leaf, charcoal-grilled hamburger and funky, roasted berry. The palate feels rough and bumpy, while the flavor profile is herbal to an extreme. Finishes green and soupy.","91723":"Dry red fruit and tomato notes define the nose on this light-colored Pinot. Flavors of earthy cherry and spice get buried under buttery oak, which carries through onto the finish.","91739":"This is stalky smelling, with modest fruit and a burnt field aroma. It looks and tastes weak and transparent, with sourness rising up on the palate along with notes of citrus, cranberry and cherry pie.","91792":"Light oak and spice aromas blend with baked berry, graphite and vanilla scents. This feels grabby, with gritty, lightly stalky flavors of leather that overshadow the wine's modest fruit components. The wine is peppery, oaky and a bit raw and pinching on the finish.","91839":"A fleshy wine with aromas of wet clay and earth. It seems a little hot and herbal at its foundation, but around the edges there are flavors of cherry and raspberry. The feel is chunky and innocuous, with mild tannins.","91930":"Waxy aromas suggest haystack and dusty apple. This is on the borderline of heavy and cloying in the mouth, while oak is the main driver of the flavor profile. On the finish, notes of melon and banana are covered by a resiny oak flavor.","92004":"Monteviejo, one of the Clos de los Siete wineries, has entered the unofficial \u201cfun Malbec\u201d category with Festivo, which has a stemmy, slightly burnt character that is present from start to finish. Along the way there are leathery black fruit flavors, herbal qualities and a good mouthfeel. Decent wine but decidedly herbal and stemmy.","92016":"Fairly brambly and a little sour on the bouquet, with prickly fruit aromas. The palate is just as sharp and angular, without much cushion to fall back on. Flavors of cherry and raspberry are slightly herbal and tart, while the finish is more of the same. Not as round and ripe as you'd expect for an $18 Malbec.","92069":"Soft, ripe and chocolaty, with a raisiny quality on the bouquet. There's fading black plum and wild berry flavors; the mouthfeel is big but short on structure. Finishes with medium length and mild bitterness.","92156":"The blend is Malbec with Syrah and Merlot, and the nose is earthy, with heat and grainy oak along with blackberry notes. A lush, rich, supple palate features earthy, leathery blackberry flavors with coffee and bacon notes coming from the barrel. Smooth and long on the finish; drink through 2021.","92162":"La Arena (sand) is one of four soil-based 2012 Altamira Malbecs made by TintoNegro, and the similarities among the wines far outweigh the differences. This is ripe and oaky on the nose, but clean and approachable. The palate is medium-to-full in feel, while flavors of black cherry, cassis and vanilla end with mild heat and baking spice notes. Drink through 2020.","92163":"La Grava (gravel) shows only modest differences from the silt, stone and sand wines in TintoNegro's soil-based series of 2012 Malbecs. Black-fruit aromas, herbal notes and solidity define the nose, while the palate is tight, juicy and racy, with red-fruit acidity. Nervy plum and raspberry flavors come with chocolaty oak and an agile, spicy finish. Drink through 2021.","92164":"La Piedra (stone) opens with the same ripe berry, plum, licorice and oaky aromas as La Arena, La Grava and El Limo (the other wines in this series). The palate is bright and fairly juicy, with black cherry, dark plum, baking spice and peppery flavors. A firm, lightly toasted, racy finish seems right for this wine. Drink through 2020.","92176":"Black cherry and medicinal aromas dominate an earthy, dense nose. A ton of energy is unloaded on a grabby, aggressive palate that's packed with cherry, plum and cough drop flavors. This is ripe, forward and fresh, with brown-sugar sweetness to the finish. Drink through 2024.","92319":"DiamAndes continues to put out clunky Viogniers from the Uco Valley. This is bland and waxy on the nose, with notes of green melon and nectarine. The palate is round and full but lacks personality, while flavors of papaya and melon are heavy and finish yeasty.","92373":"Exotic aromas of cardamom, blueberry and spiced currant filter onto a fresh but wide-bodied palate with raspberry, blueberry, herb and spice flavors. The finish is intriguing due to a reprise of notes like anise, mint and herbal berry flavors.","92379":"Meaty, gritty aromas of earth, animal hide and horseradish introduce an intense, chewy, saturated but slightly clumsy palate with blackened berry, plum, carob and vanilla flavors. An oaky, medicinal tasting finish is potent but not very complex.","92515":"Baked berry, savory bacon and coconut aromas give this Cab a modern, sweet outlook. In the mouth, it's more raw and abrasive, with firm tannins and lemony acids. Flavors of baked berry fruits and resiny oak finish chewy and tannic, with a touch of heat.","92547":"Ripe malty berry aromas blend seamlessly with darker notes of toasty oak and asphalt. This Cab Franc (with 15% Malbec) feels big and pulpy, but also healthy and juicy. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and mixed herbs finish with oaky notes of mocha, coffee and toasty berry. Drink through 2024.","92599":"Mossy and quite woody, and maybe even bretty, but also rich and stout, with concentration. Aromas of cheesey black fruit are staunch, while the round palate has richness, thickness and flavors of molasses, baked berries and licorice. Finishes surprisingly quick.","92603":"Nice from the get-go, with lime, citrus and fresh herb aromas. The palate is round and whole, with easygoing flavors of lemon, mango, papaya and melon. Fresh and pleasant on the finish, and perfect for aperitifs.","92648":"Light aromas of white fruits and honeysuckle are welcoming. This feels clean and balanced, with flavors of tropical fruits, sweet citrus, pineapple and mango. It finishes sweet and almost sugary, but not quite.","92674":"This wine blends the rich qualities of Malbec with proper acidity and tannic bite, and the result is excellent. Chocolaty aromas of berry fruits and leather set up a bouncy palate with oaky flavors of mocha, plum, herbs and spice. On the finish, it's long and a touch minty. Drink now\u20132018.","92686":"If you like big Malbecs, this blend of grapes from three elevations is up your alley. Graphite, blackberry, mocha and vanilla aromas are inviting, while the rich, sappy palate houses coffee, cooked berry and coconut flavors. It's oaky, ripe, heavy and full of power. Drink now\u20132016.","92853":"Fully oaked, and you can tell via the aromas of coconut, resin, vanilla and latex that sit on top of tobacco and floral berry scents. Feels tight and high in acid, with herbal-leaning red berry flavors. Fresh and basic on the finish, with lasting acidity.","92861":"With ripe aromas of cough syrup, baked berry, cherry and smoke, this Malbec offers a bit of everything. The palate is full but has energy, and the flavors of boysenberry, blueberry and chocolate come in a big, pounding wave. Finishes chunky and jammy, with adequate freshness.","92873":"Quite piercing and fiery at first, which announces that it is fully oaked. Along the way there's savory notes, saucy leather and flashes of dark fruit. This would be a better wine with more fruit and flesh, and less barrel. The dill, vanilla and spice flavors are a bit too dominant.","93149":"Slightly baked aromas of raisin, blackberry and caramel are deep and dense more than bright. This Malbec blend is well built, with spicy flavors of berry fruits and cocoa. The oak on the finish is toasty and leads to dryness and a sense of fineness. Drink through 2023.","93237":"Herbal, jammy aromas of raspberry and plum are spicy but reedy. This feels a bit heavy and out of shape. Stewy, baked blackberry flavors are interwoven with herb and spice notes, while this Malbec-Cabernet blend tastes mostly of chocolate, prune and herbs on a chunky finish.","93321":"Very little stands out on the bouquet other than a whiff of oak and applesauce. This feels juicy and acidic, thus fresh, while flavors of apple and citrus feed into a citrusy finish with a touch of oak.","93326":"Hard candy and berry-extract aromas form the nose. This is slick in feel, with mulberry, raspberry, lollipop and olive flavors, a true mish-mash of tastes. A jammy sweetness drives the finish, which is short on structure.","93333":"Horsey smelling and muddled on the nose, this Malbec offers a mix of many things, but true harmony isn't one of them. The palate is lactic in feel, while roasted flavors of black fruits and bacon finish with candied sweetness.","93335":"Gooseberry and feline aromas are true to the variety but a bit austere and sharp. The palate is plump like you'd expect from warm-climate SB, while flavors of nectarine, citrus and melon finish full, tangy and a bit heavy.","93710":"Heavy white-fruit aromas manage to stay fresh, while in the mouth this is ripe and chunky. Flavors suggest melon, creamy oak and banana. The finish is warm and sticky.","93877":"Competent from the start, with well-formed fruity aromas of raspberry and plum. There's even some leather and dried cheese to the nose. In the mouth, it's all about earthy, intense berry fruit and juicy freshness. Finishes a little tart but lively, with good form and feel.","93942":"Floral plum and berry aromas mingle with a sweet rubber note. In the mouth, this is crisp, staunch and a touch choppy, with flavors of oak, vanilla and berry fruits. A firm finish is earthy and slightly muddled in flavor.","93965":"Youthful raspberry and strawberry aromas bring a little cotton candy as well, while the palate is round, a touch soft and shows bouncy berry and citrus flavors. Solid and tastes just about right, but a bit cloying toward the end.","93969":"Sort of prickly, wild, rubbery and inconsistent, but it's also endowed with interesting olive, cracked pepper, herb and briney notes to go along with intense, dark berry core flavors. Finishes mildly burnt and bitter, which Bonarda is prone to do.","93977":"Dark, mossy and rich on the nose, with dried cheese, leather, baked character and heat that pretty much comes with the territory. The palate is smooth but not flabby, with blackberry, dark plum and chocolate flavors. Mildly herbal and long on the finish, with balance. An impressive example of blended Malbec and Syrah.","93996":"Saturated, inky Malbec with plenty of sweet mocha, chocolate and vanilla to go with black fruit aromas. The palate is big and bold but controlled, with compact, intense flavors of berry, leather and black tea. Smooth on the finish, with soft, integrated tannins and just enough acidity to maintain freshness. Drink this year.","94097":"Aromas of cherry Lifesaver and red currant are medicinal. This has a thick, sticky, cough-syrup mouthfeel and dark, medicinal flavors of stewed plum, burnt brown sugar and cr\u00e8me de cassis. Heat and sticky grab define the finish on this sweet Malbec.","94410":"Grapey berry aromas come with sweet, reedy notes and a brandied cherry component. It feels condensed but lively, with a mix of sweet, almost tropical flavors that hint at pineapple, wild berry and herb. Tasted twice; this score and note reflects both tastings.","94534":"Wiry, slightly grassy aromas of raspberry and plum come with a touch of oaky vanilla. This Malbec feels downright hard and choppy due to tough gritty tannins. Plum and berry flavors come in blips rather than a harmonious whole, and this tastes of lactic oak and rubber on the finish.","94618":"Slightly grassy herbal-leaning plum and berry aromas include a note of pencil shavings. This feels solid and not too heavy. Roasted berry and cassis flavors don't vary or evolve in front of a slightly reedy tasting finish. Drink this maturing, middle-aged Malbec through 2019.","94632":"An earthy heavily oaked nose includes jammy notes of spiced black plum. A thick beefy chewy palate delivers savory herbal black-fruit flavors. A blocky finish is tannic, and overall the sum is about equal to its parts. Drink through 2021.","94776":"Earthy and ripe, this midnight-black Cab opens with ripe aromas of prune, tobacco and oak-related coconut. A tannic, resiny palate deals rich, heady flavors of mocha, blackberry and coconut, while an oak-dominated finish heaps on a final dose of coconut along with hard tannins. Drink through 2021.","94787":"Horsey berry aromas join forces with molasses, vanilla and graphite. Ripped with power, this Malbec's tartaric acidity is amplified and scratchy. Baked plum, blackberry and vanilla flavors end with abrasive residual acidity that creates length but also edginess. Drink through 2021.","94891":"Weinert has always pushed the more traditional, less extracted style. And this Bordeaux blend shows a nose of light spice, cinnamon, wet clay and subdued berry fruit. The palate is earthy, with hints of tomato, herbs, raspberry and cocoa. It's a drying wine, with grabby tannins, but it should age well for another few years. Drink now or hold through 2011.","94901":"A big wine, but some persistent sulphur and earthiness on the nose results in aromas of leather, scrambled eggs and tobacco. Rugged on the palate, but that's to be expected for a big-boned Malbec like this. Flavors of blackberry and black cherry are supported by powerful oak, leather and an infusion of herbs. Drinkable now and best through 2010.","94911":"Woody berry and cassis aromas are inviting and strong. This feels high in acidity and maybe more racy than you'd expect for Luj\u00e1n. Dry, spicy red-fruit flavors flow on a stream of potent acidity, while this finishes tangy, herbal and spicy, with a zesty note of pie cherry. Drink through 2022.","94922":"Lush, jammy, soft aromas of black plum and cassis are full but a touch lazy. On first take, this feels saturated but deeper examination reveals zesty tartaric acidity. Flavors of jammy black fruits are a touch citric, while this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is plump on the finish. Drink through 2020.","94932":"Blackberry, earth and spice aromas prove that a bouquet can be complete with only a few ingredients. This feels rugged and tannic. Flavors of coconut, buttery oak and toast support berries fruit. This is choppy and pounds its way through the finish. Drink through 2021.","95128":"Inky berry and smoky, minerally aromas of charcoal properly introduce a saturated palate with tons of oak but even more fruit at its base. This supercharged Malbec is almost over the top, with massive blackberry, chocolate and molasses flavors. Burnt toast and chocolate mint-chip flavors on the finish confirm that this is a monster red. Drink through 2023.","95161":"Plum, tomato and spice aromas turn more floral with airing. This is a dry pinching tannic Malbec with herbal plum and cherry flavors that are also peculiarly salty. A tannic dry sturdy finish offers plenty to chew on. Drink through 2022.","95245":"Deep, dense, compact aromas of black fruits, marzipan and sandalwood are exotic and inviting. This blend of Malbec and Cabernet Franc feels flush and layered, while integrated flavors of chocolate, blackberry, spice and oak finish long and woody, but not overly oaky. Drink through 2017.","95493":"Straightforward aromas of black currant and dark plum help create a rich style of Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a syrupy palate that's made firmer by driving tannins. It features a lot of chocolate, baked black-plum and mild herbal flavors. It's ultraconcentrated, and more driving than discerning.","95559":"Fiery at first, this also has mint and toast notes to the otherwise black-fruit-scented nose. It feels tannic and drawing, but strong boned. Flavors of roasted black fruit are bolstered by olive, chocolate and spicy toast accents. Finishes savory and firm.","95560":"Pencil lead and rubbery, mature berry aromas open this wine. The palate is driven by energetic, pounding tannins and flavors of black cherry and tomato, which become more prominent as the tannins and acid rebound. This is an indication of how Argentine Cabernet Sauvignon ages.","95575":"Familar aromas of cherry, plum and berry are on the money. This is tight as nails on the palate, this and nevertheless thrusts with boysenberry, blackberry and a hint of amaro. A wall of finishing tannin carries flavors of chocolate and black spice. Big, ripe and serious.","95721":"Dark dense tarry aromas of blackberry and cassis are a touch stewy and flat. This feels wide and grabby, with grapy flavors of blackberry and plum. A jammy feeling finish with berry flavors has a dark and toasty side to it.","95830":"Aromas of balsam wood, dry spice, berries and vanilla are attractive and inviting. It feels lush and deep, with good layering and robust flavors of berry fruit, spice, herb and tobacco. Flush and slightly herbal tasting on the back end, this is a complex, quality blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah.","95834":"Norton Reserva is one of Argentina's best Cabernetss for the money. This vintage offers a mineral aroma along with rose petal, baked plum and spiced cherry scents. It feels deep, generous and balanced, with cassis, blackberry, earth and molasses flavors.","95912":"Rubber, mushroom and smoke rise up on the hot, molten nose, while the palate is hard, tough to penetrate and narrow, with dark berry and piercing pepper accents. Tough to dig into and find higher qualities. Thus it comes across as a surface wine without much depth or elegance.","95913":"Almost red in color, and maybe already past its prime. Crios was a standout in 2006, but the '07 is chunky and sweet smelling, with ripe but dull apple, melon and nectarine flavors. Soft and already in its late stages; probably best to wait for the 2008.","95916":"Try as we might to understand very ripe Bonarda blended with low-acid Malbec, it doesn't make sense...and this example doesn't help much. It's a little green and funky, with mineral, asphalt and prune aromas. The palate is soft, semidark and baked, with chocolate and medium tannins on the finish. A strange blend that comes out strange.","95919":"Santa Carolina of Chile is behind this Uco Valley producer, and for two years running this wine has rated the same. It starts with adequate but generic plum and blackberry aromas, yet the palate is acidic and tangy, with slightly herbal black fruit and raspberry flavors. Decent but not what you'd call a distinguished Cabernet. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.","95932":"A little sweet on the nose, with powdered sugar, vanilla and white fruit aromas. Feels foamy but just fresh enough, with apple, melon and controlled stalky flavors. Finishes with dry apple notes. Good for Argentine sparkling; 70% Chardonnay and 30% Chenin Blanc.","95942":"White peach and papaya aromas are sweet and tropical, while saline notes play second fiddle. Feels tangy, juicy and lean, with dilute lemon and green banana flavors. Wet and watery on the finish.","95946":"Every kind of pepper, from green to red to jalape\u00f1o, is present on the nose, along with red plum and spice aromas. Feels tight and zesty, with Italian-leaning flavors of tomato, oregano and basil along with cassis and strawberry. Crisp and agile on the finish, but tastes green.","95970":"Fiery stuff with aromas that suggest cheese and leather. The mouth has a forward feel and then leafy, herbal berry flavors with sides of compost and leather. Lightly herbal on the finish, and while it's big, sweet and chunky, it doesn't click to the maximum.","95972":"A bit warm and baked on the nose, with aromas of fruit cake and pastry. The palate is full-bodied and chewy, with ripe, sweet black fruit flavors that finish with vanilla and chocolate.","95973":"Earthy and a bit foresty on the nose, with a leather accent to the berry aromas. Full and reasonably sound across the palate, which offers baked berry and coffee flavors in front of a modest, leathery finish.","96043":"Oak, resin, briary fruit and pasty notes characterize the bouquet. The palate is wiry due to pronounced tartaric acidity, but fair overall. Flavors of rooty berry and brown sugar taste sweet, while the finish is low in verve.","96048":"Spicy, jammy aromas of plum and blackberry are dense yet soft. This feels syrupy and rich, almost sticky, with grabby oak and blackened flavors of berry fruits that ultimately register as nondescript. A peppery, hot finish is plump but low on detail.","96153":"This Syrah smells meaty and roasted, with savory spice aromas and plenty of black fruit on the nose. It's chewy and creamy feeling, with blueberry and blackberry flavors in front of a short finish that's abrupt but clean.","96180":"Lightly herbal berry and plum aromas are uncomplicated. A medium-full palate tastes of generic berry fruits and plum. Rubbery tannins make for a tight drawing finish.","96185":"Buttercup and tropical fruit aromas are related to the 80% Torront\u00e9s in this blend (Viognier and Chardonnay are 10% each). This is plump but also high in acidity. Salty flavors of tropical fruits and pink grapefruit are retained on the finish.","96233":"Stalky, baked aromas are bland. The wine feels tannic and scratchy, while flavors of generic berry fruits are herbal, reedy and wear a lot of cover-up oak. Minty, herbal notes drive the finish on this green-leaning Cab.","96235":"Aromas of white fruits and apple are slightly mealy and set up flavors of melon and tangy but pithy citrus. The finish is even more pithy. Overall this wine feels like it's starting to fade.","96247":"Aromas of briny citrus and resiny oak don't blend together well. In the mouth, this oaky Viognier is grabby and resiny, with bitter green-fruit flavors. The finish is pithy with hard green notes.","96248":"Apricot, peach pit and matchstick are the lead aromas on this basic Chardonnay. Flavors of melon and apricot are lightly oxidized and nutty, while the finish is salty and slightly bitter, with a dab of honey for an offset.","96250":"Aromas are raisiny and baked to the max. Likewise, the palate seems chunky and heavy. Flavors of cooked berry fruits are loamy and flat, while the finish lacks pulse.","96257":"This salmon-colored ros\u00e9 is past its peak. Gritty aromas are turning oily, while the feel is chunky and sticky, with a touch of lasting citric acidity. Flavors of melon and almond skins finish bitter.","96261":"Aromas of latex, iodine and stewed berry fruits are challenging. This Cab Franc feels jumbled, chunky and a bit out of shape. Herbal, woody notes ride heavily on top of saucy, lightly green berry flavors. It finishes with green-leaning mint, basil and fennel notes.","96275":"Candied berry aromas include a mild spice note. This 50-50 blend of Cabernet and Malbec feels juicy but short on depth. Spicy, briny red-fruit flavors dry out on a finish with red bell pepper and black-pepper notes.","96280":"Jammy, roasted aromas are more savory and offbeat than common and fruity. This Malbec has a fresh but choppy mouthfeel and flavors of tomato, basil and herbal berry fruits. A savory finish conforms with the rest of the wine.","96283":"A hard coating of woodspice sits atop herbal plum and berry aromas. This feels tough and nearly impermeable. Spicy, briary plum flavors are lean and taste woody on a dry, tannic finish.","96467":"Lactic oak, wood grain, pencil lead, animal hide, lemon peel and berry aromas make for a challenging bouquet. This is a bit flabby and low on spine, while soft flavors of jammy berry fruits are herbal and suggest juniper. Eucalyptus and raspberry flavors are prominent on the finish.","96625":"Grapey and inky on the nose, this feels saturated and a bit hot on the palate, with a candied blueberry flavor leading to a grapey finish. Tasted twice, months apart, with similar findings; this score reflects both tastings.","96833":"Scratchy black cherry aromas come with a strong hint of tree bark and cedar resin. This feels snappy at first, then more resiny and oaky upon airing. Woody black-fruit flavors get a boost from juicy acidity, while an oaky finish tastes like mint and licorice.","97060":"A little funky and jumpy at first, but it settles down. Rapsberry, pepper and a hint of green herb give it a snappy outlook, and while it's mostly solid, it may be a tiny bit stretched compared to others. In between the folds, there's mocha, pepper and a reedy bite. Nice wine with a couple of minor flaws.","97071":"Cadus from Nieto Senetiner has not been overly consistent in recent years. This wine is black as night, with ultra-extracted aromas of black fruit and chocolate. The palate is hunky and chunky, with clumsy grape, cassis and blackberry flavors. Shows a blast of coconut and softness on the finish. A classic fruit bomb that's missing some key parts.","97183":"Dull aromas of murky leaves and wet cement don't set things up well. This is clunky and scouring in feel, with leafy blackberry flavors that finish bitter.","97329":"Seemingly more candied and sweet than prior years, but still a reasonably good generic-style Cabernet if you don't mind a little sucking candy and gumball along the route. Flavors of strawberry and cassis are sticky but ripe, while the finish is chewy and sweet.","97334":"Somewhat smoky and earthy on the nose, but also with some harshness that could be chalked up to youth. Acidity is a bit too high and there's some pickle to the bouquet and flavor profile. On the plus side, as it opens core flavors of raspberry and red plum come across as solid.","97335":"Tropical aromas arise from the bouquet of this unoaked new Chardonnay, and there's some pineapple and lemon-lime thrown in. Flavors of apple sauce, cinnamon and lime juice are sweet and tasty, while the mouthfeel is simple and fleshy. Drink now for the wine's youthful jump.","97353":"Quite raisiny and pruny, from nose to palate to finish. But along the way there are touches of chocolate, earth, leather and cassis that help keep it afloat. And while we'd say it's probably too old and flat to warrant much of your time, it does have just enough pulse to still be alive. Imported by Vinecrest Co.","97378":"Smoky, spicy plum and berry aromas turn more stalky and herbal as this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon blend unwinds. In the mouth, screechy acidity yields scratchiness, while flavors of mocha, black plum, vanilla and stalky berry fruits finish tough, with oversize residual tartaric acidity; drink through 2022.","97404":"A lot of different aromas are vying for attention; there's spearmint, potting soil, tobacco and black fruits. The palate is saturated and pretty deep for what can best be described as a \u201cvalue\u201d wine. Flavors of blackberry and dark plums are wholesome and tasty. It's nicely balanced on the whole, with medium tannins.","97490":"At first this seems over the top (it's 15.8%). But give the wine time and you'll find the ultimate presentation of ripeness, richness and depth. The flavors are thick and black, with chunky black plum, prune, syrup and more. But it's also healthy and not flabby, with balance and a sense of being. Excellent if you like monster reds.","97502":"Potent Malbec with aromas of leather, bacon, blackberry and smoke. It's thick and dense, but well balanced, with flavors of blackberry, cola, pepper and nutmeg. More smooth and easy than complex, with a long, creamy, sweet finish that cements the wine's character. Probably the best Felino Malbec to date, and a good value at 20 bucks.","97550":"This is a varietally correct Cabernet with minty oak, mild herb aromas and toasty, solid berry fruit scents on the bouquet. Although it's a bit scouring and tough on the palate, flavors of raspberry, plum and herbs are spicy and right. On the finish, oaky vanilla and lemony notes settle in.","97553":"With floral violet aromas, leather and meaty notes, this smells bold and ready. A firm, slightly reduced-feeling palate offers blue and black flavors of blueberry, prune and bitter chocolate. The finish is a bit hot and narrow, but shows power and intensity.","97590":"More minerally and tight than most, with a bit of brine and lettuce to go with tropical fruit aromas. The palate is citrusy and features a beam of bright acidity that props up melon and citrus flavors. Full and forceful late, with some burn to the finish.","97613":"Floral raspberry aromas are jammy and funky, like many Cafayate Malbecs are prone to be. This feels juicy but high in acidity, so it's pointy on the palate. Exotic plum and raspberry flavors follow the nose, while the finish is fresh, high in acidity and low on cushion.","97619":"Aromas of cedar, vanilla and cassis are the best part of this hard, clampy, ultratannic Cabernet. Flavors of vanilla and coconut soften and enrich screechy plum and red-berry fruit, while this finishes with a dominating narrow, tartaric feel.","97729":"Wiry, pinched aromas of berry fruits are forward and direct. This feels chunky and a touch jammy, while herbal berry, plum and peppery flavors end with heat, power, rawness and medicinal berry notes.","97730":"Ripe blackberry aromas are welcoming and clean. This features a flush palate that hollows out while delivering generic but fresh black-fruit flavors. A tasty, fresh finish makes this good for everyday drinking.","97761":"Dark in color and aromas. The nose starts out sulfuric and gassy, but settles on rubber and earthy black fruit. In the mouth, there's poking, prodding acidity and basic flavors of blackberry, herbal tea and leather. Grabby on the finish, with a mild acidic scour.","97773":"Charred and smells of coffee, toasted oak, minty berry fruit and earth. The palate is quite tannic, with creamy vanilla flavors along with candied berry fruit and lemony zest. Exhibits mostly faux oak and window dressing, but for $11 it isn't bad.","97874":"Rusty in color for a young wine, with mulchy, faded berry fruit aromas. It has life on the palate, which tastes earthy, peppery and a little bit burnt. A dry, spicy wine with cherry flavors interspersed.","97883":"Opens with funky, earthy aromas of juniper, herbs, green pepper and baked berry fruits. It's thick and grabby in the mouth, with roasted, herbal plum and berry flavors. Leathery and slightly burnt tasting on the finish.","97892":"Smells jumpy and musky, like a wet dog in from the rain. The palate is brutally tannic and hard as rocks, with sweet, pasty berry flavors infused with vanilla. Finishes like the bouquet: foxy and funky.","97951":"A resiny, oily nose is barrel heavy and a strong clue of what's to come. The palate has a thick, syrupy feel and sweet, almost sugary flavors of pear and melon. By the time it's wrapping up, the wine veers towards cloying. Has its virtues but it's entirely too sweet in this critic's opinion.","97960":"Muddled apple and spice aromas are o.k. and improve with familiarity. The palate runs narrow and tight, with sharp acidity and stalky flavors of lemon, green apple and lime. Finishes fresh and cutting, with controlled pithiness. 70% Chardonnay and 30% SB.","97963":"Sulphuric at first, with citrus and air freshener aromas. The palate has a certain roundness and fleshy quality, while the flavors are sweet, melony and a little oily. Some almond-skin bitterness rises up late, most likely reflecting the 25% Viognier in the blend.","98018":"Oily citrus and barrel-based smoke aromas set up a palate that's deep and powerful. Flavors of spiced apple, citrus and butterscotch are solid and don't fade over the course of a long, slightly pithy tasting finish.","98022":"This opaque, fully extracted blend of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon smells outright grapy, with a spunky pomegranate note. A syrupy laziness to the palate and jammy blackberry flavors finish chewy, with a leaning towards Concord grape. Tasted twice with similar findings.","98121":"This almost translucent brick-colored Pinot offers aromas of lettuce leaf, orange peel and dried red fruits. It's light, edgy and fresh in feel, with flavors of salted meat and herbal plum. A tangy citric finish is primed with racy acidity. Fermented and aged in egg-shaped cement tanks.","98129":"Jammy oaky blueberry and cardamon aromas are proprietary for Mendoza Malbec. In the mouth, hard tannins combined with high acidity make things a bit awkward, while this tastes of reedy plum, raspberry and raw oak. Unabsorbed tartaric acidity on the finish creates a wiry feel, while peppery, spicy flavors are lasting and herbal.","98322":"Attractive berry aromas are candied and a tiny bit leafy. Tartaric acidity is front and center on the palate, but there's enough tasty yet generic berry flavors along with notes of clove and chocolate to handle forced acidity.","98326":"This Cabernet Franc blend opens with herbal oaky aromas of coffee and red fruits. The palate feels tartaric and shocking, with heavy extraction and an overall wiry feel. Jacked-up berry flavors come with more than enough oak, while this is steady but not finessed or elegant on the finish. Drink through 2021.","98340":"This Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon blend opens with blueberry and currant aromas that hint at the exotic. A flush racy palate is high in acid and a touch abrasive. Plum and currant flavors are not what you'd call cushioned, while this ends with hard edgy tannins and a reprise of scouring acidity. In terms of aging, this will last a long time. Drink through 2027.","98627":"Ripe blackberry, cassis and refined wood are the key aromas on this fruit-forward, slightly grapy Malbec that's full and jammy on the palate, with big, bold flavors of boysenberry, chocolate and spices. There's not a ton of nuance to this bruiser, which finishes with toast and chocolate flavors and a rich residual feel. Drink through 2017.","98640":"This is another excellent Malbec in Trapiche's single-vineyard series. Aromas of anise and licorice are exotic and a bit unusual, while blueberry, blackberry and herbal hints fill out the bouquet. The palate is full and jammy, maybe a touch soft, with layered flavors of black fruits, pepper and toast. A stocky finish with a licorice reprise shows a spot of heat. Drink through 2017.","98666":"Lightly oaked melon aromas are easygoing. This feels bright and citrusy, with good acidity but not much depth. Stone-fruit and tropical flavors finish with enough kick to hang around for a while.","98668":"Latex and baked-bean aromas are candied at first, then grassy. This Malbec is intense but harsh in feel. Herbal plum and currant flavors are slightly horsey, and it feels hot and scratchy on a minty, herbal finish.","98901":"This blend of Malbec, Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah opens with oak-driven aromas of hard spices and briny berry fruits. The palate is wiry and juicy in feel, with pointed acidity. Baked berry flavors plus strong notes of clove and nutmeg finish spicy, with a lasting blend of cocoa and saltiness.","98992":"Basic sweet berry aromas come across like fruit punch. The palate has a standard, solid mouthfeel and generic berry flavors. A little bit medicinal on the finish, and overall it's your regular everyday red wine with not much varietal character. 50% each Sangiovese and Bonarda.","99001":"Opens with rubbery, gaseous aromas that morph into latex and finally briary berry. The palate has a highly regular, tannic feel along with minty, generic flavors of berry and herbs. Basil and spice notes show up on the mildly green finish. Contains 15% Malbec and Syrah.","99015":"Citrus and peach aromas are basic but clean. The palate starts out fresh and easy before losing some steam, but along the way there's peach, green apple and dry melon flavors. Good for a simple, tropical-style white wine.","99077":"Saline and oak aromas are dominant, with tropical fruit scents and apple also registering. This is medium in body, with cutting citric acidity. Flavors of briny oak, popcorn and banana finish salty.","99079":"Peppery black cherry and blackberry aromas blend in secondary aromas of wet dog hair, candied red fruits and jerky. This blend of 70% Malbec and 30% Cab Franc feels plump and chunky, with leafy, herbal berry flavors. Oak and mild green notes dominate the rustic, spicy finish.","99092":"Easy aromas of bath oil and mixed tropical fruits are mellow, with nothing too defined. A fresh, lithe palate offers bright acidity and flavors of orange and grapefruit. Light acidity and tropical flavors create a friendly, simple finish.","99207":"Deep purple in color, with an inky nose that brings licorice and jammy black fruit aromas. This is a lush, soft-bodied style of Syrah with a meaty mouthfeel and candied, jammy flavors of blackberry and stewed black cherry. Finishes sweet and chocolaty; could use a bit more structure and spine.","99208":"Earthy and spicy on the nose, with tomato and raisin but also some herbal green, which is likely attributable to the 50% Cabernet in this Malbec-CS blend. Tame on the palate, with tomatoey notes and dry raspberry flavors. Simple and pleasant but more herbal and less exciting that Gradum's straight '05 Malbec.","99248":"Spicy tomato aromas show an herbal side as well as red plum and cranberry notes. In the mouth, this is ratcheted down and crisp, with fine acidity creating ideal Pinot framework. Flavors of briny plum and currant end more oaky and rich, with a light caramel note to go with lasting dried red-fruit flavors.","99314":"Reedy and green on the nose, then choppy and clipped on the palate. For a full-priced Malbec, this is lacking in ripeness, body and finesse; it's prickly and limited, with green bean, rhubarb and cranberry flavors. Not bad but underwhelming for $33.","99333":"Smells like fresh berries and perfume, which is good. In the mouth, it's weighty and sticky, with just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Tastes cranked up and wild, with plum and nectarine flavors leading the charge. Sugary on the finish, with a slightly cloying feel.","99411":"Dry, spicy aromas work well with core raspberry and earthy notes. The palate has a healthy mouthfeel and honest flavors of brown sugar, toast and black cherry. Spice and tempered caramel flavors grace the finish, which has vigor and confirms the value factor and overall quality.","99418":"A sappy, jammy nose offers a nice entry to this simple blend of Cabernet and Merlot. The palate feel is regular and healthy, while the flavors run toward generic red fruits with a touch of green herbs and caramel. Snappy and crisp on the finish.","99426":"Minerally and dry smelling, with floral aromas along with the scents of white peach and apple. The palate feels good and clean, with roundness matched by nice acidity. Flavors of spiced apple and pith are supported by zestiness, while the finish is honest. Not many value-priced Viogniers can match this.","99428":"A touch rubbery and medicinal if you get deep into the bouquet, with sizable berry aromas to boot. The palate is comfortable and balanced, with earthy black fruit flavors that suggest fig and blackberry. Toasty and chocolaty on the finish.","99458":"Normally we're leery about new brands with catchy names, but this one does chart a new direction...and it's a good one. A little sweet and teetering on syrupy on the nose, this Malbec draws it back in the mouth and shows balanced black fruit flavors, thickness, saturation and length. Thoroughly modern in style.","99465":"Baked apple, toast, spun sugar and fresh summer corn aromas are appealing and totally New World, while the palate is tropical in flavor and racy in feel. An example of acidity and ripe fruit working together to create a tasty but ripe-styled Chardonnay. Drink now.","99546":"Oak-fermented Torront\u00e9s is a sketchy category to begin with, and this example doesn't really help things. Aromas of wood resin, cured ham and pool water set up woody, soapy, resiny flavors. What's best about this is the mouthfeel, which is balanced and braced by solid acidity.","99562":"Aromas of generic red-berry fruits, leather and a drop of vinegar feed into a grabby palate with medicinal red-berry flavors. This tastes a touch herbal on a standard finish.","99625":"Pure on the nose, with plenty of pop. Aromas of dark black cherry are tight and smoky, with minerality. Flavors of cola and wild-berry fruits are right on the money, and the feel is firm but deep and layered. Offers fine character and ageability. A blend of Malbec from three top vineyards; drink through 2014.","99689":"Warm and honeyed Chardonnay with toast and melon aromas. The body is big but the acidity is staunch enough to keep things moving. Flavors of toast and coconut sweeten up apple and melon fruit, and the finish is lasting.","99792":"Crisp minerally aromas of cherry and blackberry come with toasty spicy accents. This is a tightly built full-bodied Cab with lightly herbal, moderately oaky and saucy flavors of berry and plum. A dry, spicy finish provides for a strong ending.","99794":"Ripe but constricted plum and raspberry aromas are firmly in the red-fruit zone. This feels good and fresh, with tomatoey acidity. Saucy plum and red-currant flavors finish nicely, with rubbery tannins. Drink through 2019.","99807":"Boysenberry and exotic notes of all-spice and cardamom set this Malbec apart from the field. In the mouth, this is typically angular, with sharp acidity and not much cushion. A one-note, linear flavor of rooty plum is neither fruity nor dry, while the finish fails to rise or fall; it just hums along on a singular beam of acid. Drink from 2018\u20132030.","99895":"This is a textbook Deep Purple special: huge berry, menthol and violet aromas create a hefty, lusty bouquet. In the mouth, it is more narrow than you might hope for, with staunch tartaric acidity. Jammy berry flavors are big but standard, as is the finish. Drink through 2018.","99898":"Floral aromas of violet and black fruits include an oak-driven scent of plastic. In the mouth, this PV is plump and widespread, maybe even a bit flabby. Flavors of salty, leafy, spicy berry and black cherry are dry, meaty and toasty on the finish, with subtle tannins. Drink through 2016.","100046":"Jammy and dark, with big berry and coffee aromas. The palate has a hard intensity to it that I haven't seen before from this wine, with bitterness along with black cherry, chocolate and toasty flavors. It's forward, firm and driving, but always hard and angular. In its defense, 2008 was a cool, difficult year with frosts at harvest time.","100052":"Clear as day in the glass, with forced oak and spring flowers in the nose. In a word, it's strange. In the mouth, you'll get sweetness and other flavors not generally associated with Chardonnay. It's not necessarily a bad white wine, but it is definitely at odds with typical Chardonnay.","100120":"Bright and bold to the eye, this has generous, powerful berry aromas that come with a note of spice. It feels stacked and only slightly tangy, with black fruit and some of Syrah's more textbook flavors of leather and animal. It holds form on the finish.","100265":"Roasted, gamy aromas are slightly cool, reedy and herbal. This wine is jammy and deep on the palate, with black-fruit flavors aided by gamy notes, spice and exotic herbs. A deep finish with bold acidity solidifies the wine's excellence. Drink through 2024; contains 15% Malbec.","100503":"A little reduced and granular on the nose, with black fruit and licorice aromas filling any gaps. The flavor profile is solid, with black cherry and plum pulling the cart. Where this wine comes up short is in mouthfeel; it's tight almost to the point of sharp, with a strong essence of grape skins and tannin. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.","100509":"Clean, fruity and a touch candied on the bouquet. The palate is narrow but saved by ripe black cherry flavors and spice notes. Finishes with a mocha-like flavor and a crisp, clean feel. A basic but more than satisfactory Malbec. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA Inc.","100512":"Sweet and a little foxy on the nose, with secondary aromas of air freshener. The flavors are a touch brambly and herbal, while the palate is flush and chewy but also a little tannic and choppy. Doesn't seem as thought this is as structured and serious as it was, say, four or five years ago.","100518":"Touches of cola, cherry and berry work the jammy bouquet, and the reasonably sturdy body offers up flavors of berry backed by vanilla. There's ample grab and pretty good balance to this fresh wine.","100533":"A lean, acidic Malbec that defies the tried and true model of richness and lots of flavor. It has rhubarb and green raspberry aromas, while the palate is short, tart and herbal. Not a lot of definition here.","100535":"Strange Chardonnay. It smells and tastes more like feeble Torront\u00e9s than Chard. The palate offers only shearing apple fruit, and the finish is hard. Can't imagine anyone pegging this as Chardonnay.","100555":"This Malbec blend is bright, jammy and grapy on the nose. The palate is juicy but bumpy and rough in feel, while fresh-fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry are a little too candied and simple for a wine of this level. A ripe medicinal finish is lush but awkward.","100648":"A bit of dust and leather for openers, with short black-fruit flavors and a big wave of tannins on the palate. So expect some grab and choppiness. Despite moderate hardness, there's good dark fruit and limited herbal intrusion.","100688":"Balsamic, dark-berry aromas come with notes of crushed minerals, coconut, resiny oak and chocolate. In the mouth, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot is tight, focused and elegant. Spicy, cedary flavors of tobacco and baked black fruits finish long, with lasting touches of tobacco and fig. Drink through 2020.","100720":"Attractive, somewhat unusual floral\/violet aromas are in the lead, with blueberry, cassis and pastry sitting behind that. The palate is smooth yet lively, with flavors of wild berry, black currant, cola, chocolate and even bacon from the French oak. Tasty, balanced and interesting; 60% Malbec and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.","100777":"Ripe blackberry, blueberry, graphite and toasty oak aromas make for a dark bouquet. This is slightly rough on the palate due to aggressive tartaric acidity, while flavors of ripe black fruits, cola, oak and chocolate finish with coconut and resiny oak notes.","101115":"With feline aromas of juniper bush, grass and sweaty citrus, this is true Sauvignon Blanc. Oak aging has lent an easiness to the mouthfeel, which shows good acidity. Flavors of green fruits, melon and pithy bitterness end in chalky clarity. This is one of Argentina's best Sauvignon Blancs.","101165":"Warm and complete, with oak-influenced char and licorice along with black fruits on the bouquet. An elegant Uco Valley specimen with refined, full-force flavors of cola, blackberry, tobacco and chocolate. Turns more complex and satisfying on the finish. Drink this high-quality value now through 2013. A blend of Malbec at 50%, with Cabernet, Petit Verdot and Syrah.","101215":"This purple saturated Malbec opens with powerful aromas of cola, tree bark and spiced blackberry. A saturated, extracted, highly tannic palate amounts to a heavy load, while baked and blackened berry flavors include a strong shot of chocolate. On the finish, more chocolate along with fig and baked berry flavors seal this rich ripe offering. Drink through 2022.","101293":"Ripe aromas of black plum, blueberry and charcoal lead to a palate that's muscular and full-bodied. Dark, peppery, slightly bitter flavors of toasted blackberry and prune end with burnt notes and black pepper along with grabby, rubbery tannins.","101306":"Aromas of raspberry, blackberry, green herbs and tar set up a blocky, jammy, chunky palate. Plum, raspberry, currant, pepper and oaky flavors are grainy and spicy, while a woody finish tastes resiny, chocolaty and toasty.","101315":"Gritty citrus aromas are dialed down. This feels racy and fairly well balanced. Mild but fresh flavors of lime, lychee and tropical fruits finish citrusy and collected. This is nothing special, but it's true and good for Torront\u00e9s.","101347":"Spearmint and weedy red-fruit aromas lead to raw palate. This is more herbal than fruity, with a lean rubbery finish.","101349":"Rustic tomato and cherry aromas make for a scratchy opening. This is wiry and grating in feel, with sour plum and red-currant flavors. A fresh but scratchy and herbal tasting finish isn't exactly friendly.","101456":"Controlled berry and plum aromas are pure and not mucked up by too much oak. Like all Luca wines, this Syrah is bulky, full-framed and meaty. It's extracted but well balanced, with mellow fruit and a dark, crusty finish. Very pleasant and chunky, but not overwhelming. Drink now or over the next year or two.","101464":"A big, woody, totally modern style of Syrah. There is a lot more coconut, mocha and big berry fruit than anything you might find from France. It's dark and layered on the palate, with coconut and resin supporting black fruit. Finishes smoky and oaky, but structured, tannic and serious enough to impress.","101480":"The best wine in the El Origen portfolio is this Torront\u00e9s from northerly Cafayate. It's true to the blueprint, showing fresh lychee, honeydew and acacia aromas, which are followed by lemon-lime flavors, green-herb notes and a touch of citrus pith. Drink now to enjoy this one's lingering tropical freshness. Imported by Carolina Wine Brands USA.","101485":"Candied red-fruit aromas are thin and limited. This is edgy, rubbery and tannic in feel, with rudimentary raspberry and red-plum flavors. A juicy finish is lean and tastes medicinal.","101495":"Stalky aromas make for a sketchy opening. In the mouth, this is blocky and grabby in feel. Burnt, underripe flavors of berry fruits are herbal and finish with grassy notes.","101502":"Flower and hay aromas lead to simple pear and spice flavors in this basic white. Mild woody notes show on the finish. Drink now.","101508":"Roasted, barnyard, leathery aromas of lemony oak and tomato are far from ideal. This has a scratchy, tartaric feel to it, while herbal raspberry flavors are backed by a mulchy aftertaste. It's stewed on the finish and weedy.","101588":"Opening with subtle berry aromas and hints of herb, rubber and leather, this is sturdy as a rock, with dry, spicy plum and cassis flavors. Powerful but restrained, it's neither overextracted nor too grapy.","101771":"Powdery aromas of acacia blossom and bath oil come prior to a slightly oily feeling palate. Pithy citrus, melon and papaya flavors finish with a touch of greenness.","101918":"Meaty, dense and rich aromas, with driving scents of prune, licorice, blackberry and cola. The palate is healthy and rich, and it keeps in step with flavors of blackberry, dark plum and savory spice. Finishes lightly roasted and dark, with a saucy aftertaste that separates it from the masses. A lusty Malbec to drink now.","102036":"Opening aromas of cola and dark fruits are belied by the tangy, edgy palate that's fresh in terms of its raspberry and plum flavors but not all that deep or complex. A clean, straightforward wine with zest but limited flavors.","102041":"Opens with fairly deep blackberry aromas, but there's also a stemmy edge to the bouquet. Generic flavors of baked plum and berry are lifted by slicing acids, while the finish bounces along before ending with some straightforward chocolate and berry notes.","102042":"Mild, light aromas of apple, toast, mineral and petrol are solid before they evaporate, while the palate is easygoing and on target, with citrus and apple flavors. Without calling it overly exciting or complex, we like the mix of Chardonnay and Viognier because it's lively, fresh and perfectly drinkable.","102087":"Light aromas of tropical fruits and white flowers are basic and open. An average feeling palate carries sweet flavors of tropical fruits like pineapple and mango accented by vanilla. Throw in a sprinkle of powdered sugar and you get the picture.","102110":"This standard Chardonnay opens with blowsy melon and papaya aromas. The palate holds onto that melony feel while dealing honeydew, papaya and fleshy apple flavors. The finish tastes sweet and kind of flat.","102278":"Basic aromas are low on fruit. This has a cutting, citric feel that's centered around juicy acidity. Sour grapefruit and tangerine flavors end with lasting citric acidity.","102415":"With little luster in the glass, this mild mossy-smelling Patagonian Malbec is saturated and pinching on the palate, with clamping tannins. Chunky incongruous berry flavors end full but rough, with a note of burnt brown sugar on the finish.","102416":"Earth, leather and herbal aromas blend with riper berry notes on the nose. This feels choppy, with cheek-scraping tannins. Flavors of minty herbal black fruits finish with chocolate, herbal flavors and stickiness.","102417":"High-elevation aromas of blueberry, herbs and bramble are accented by cumin and spiced-plum notes. This displays ample size and grip, while flavors of roasted plum and savory spices are earthy. On the finish, this is oaky and minty tasting.","102431":"Cherry and cassis aromas are earthy, with hints of green herbs and cheesy oak. This feels a bit raw and scratchy, but fresh. Red-fruit flavors of currant and plum finish with snappy acidity and clampy tannins.","102511":"Earthy leafy aromas suggest compost. This feels lean in the middle but also creamy. Spicy oaky flavors of clay and dried red fruits are light and inoffensive.","102551":"Heavy oak and spice aromas are the primary greeting on this muscular, thick, well-made Malbec. Following the lead set by the bouquet, this tastes of spicy oak, chocolate and creamy blackberry. Clove, nutmeg and chocolate flavors drive the finish.","102615":"Cloudy and a little stewy at first, which gives it a richer, plumper outward personality. With loads of earth and leather, fruit takes an early back seat before rising up in the form of black plum and berry. Finishes plump, with adequate structure. Gets better the more you get to know it.","102617":"Jammy aromas of raspberry and cherry show a slightly pickled, brambly edge, while the palate delivers tight, grabby cherry and berry flavors. There's a bit of cheesy tang to the finish, while sheering acidity and an overall light body make it food friendly.","102619":"Dark and quite oaky for a brand that earned its stripes via balanced wines that overdelivered. This vintage seems much more extracted and rough, with big, burly aromas and then tannins that grab the cheeks. Along the rough and tumble ride there's spice, pepper, blackberry and coffee. This wine pumps it out but is less polished than in the past.","102627":"The nose on this sparkler is dusty. The palate weighs in heavy, with pounding flavors of peach and melon. The finish is soda-like yet salty.","102641":"This opens with grassy, oxidized aromas of papaya and hay. The mouth is foamy and crude, with herbal, stalky flavors of salty, briny melon and nectarine. Not that it matters much, but the blend is Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc and Pinot Noir.","102643":"A yellow color announces that this isn't in tip-top shape. Stalky, waxy aromas confirm that, while a chunky, creamy feeling palate is low on acid and is showing oxidized, Sherry-like aromas of vanilla and nuts.","102644":"This smells far better than it feels or tastes. The nose offers black fruit and graham cracker notes, but the palate is sharp and punchy, with sour plum and rhubarb flavors that finish herbal and briny.","102676":"This full-bodied, layered Cabernet opens with mossy, damp aromas that suggest a forest after a rain. The palate is direct and solid, with good depth. Flavors of cola, baked plum, raisin and chocolate finish strong and with previously announced notes of cocoa, mocha and prune. Drink through 2019.","102763":"Smooth on the bouquet, with papaya, melon and other more neutral fruit aromas. The palate shows a teaspoon or two of sugary sweetness, while melon, mango and ripe apple flavors fill things out. A pleasant wine with a lightly candied way to it. Simple and basic, and decidedly not bitter.","102767":"Honest Sauvignon aromas of citrus and grapefruit set out the welcome mat. The palate follows suit with varietally correct grapefruit and lime flavors, while the finish shows club soda and other drying aspects. Not a world-beater but a pleasing wine.","102771":"A lean and clean specimen with basic but familiar raspberry and cherry aromas. The palate is a little thin and acidic, but with that comes freshness. Flavors of cherry and mixed herbs are good but sharp, while a light dusting of pepper covers the lean, snappy finish.","102779":"Chunky and murky on the nose, with melon and papaya aromas. Feels round but light in the center, with vanilla, pear and melon flavors. Fleshy and simple on the finish.","102780":"Plum, red berry and wild herb aromas combine to create a briary whole. As it airs, the nose turns lemony and hard, while the mouthfeel is tight and limited, with herbal, saucy, red berry flavors. Tomato and basil notes appear on the finish.","102792":"Citric smelling, with clipped aromas of berry fruits. Choppy tannins, heat and raisiny, sweet, cooked berry flavors and stemmy notes finish herbal tasting but full in feel.","102793":"Cloudy to the eye, with overly green aromas of tomato and bell pepper, along with spice and dried cherry. Feels hot and acidic, with a clipped, cutting palate full of berry flavors, herbs and green pepper. Fresh but herbal on the finish.","102800":"Baked plum, molasses, balsamic vinegar and cheesy oak aromas feed into a palate that's braced by a bolt of acidity. A compact set of saucy red-berry and plum flavors features tobacco and peppery accents, while the finish is mildly green in flavor, with respectable weight and balance.","102801":"Raw black-cherry aromas are direct and simple but good. This has a juicy feel that thickens over time, with oak character and extract becoming more apparent. A flavor profile driven by dark-berry fruits and smoldering oak finishes meaty but hot.","102815":"Tropical-fruit aromas are balanced by crisper apple and pear scents, while the palate is plump, round and easygoing. Flavors of pear, melon, green banana and wood spice end creamy but with adequate acidic cut.","103030":"Woody smelling up front, this is a thick, ripe Malbec with sweet plum and berry aromas and flavors. Despite feeling fat, this has adequate acidity to match resiny oak and jammy berry fruit. Wood spice is the dominant flavor on the finish.","103037":"This loud, feral Cab Franc starts with medicinal, earthy aromas. Next up is a tannic, hard, grabby palate with roasted berry, salt, char and savory flavors. An amplified roasted character carries onto the finish, which is broad and bulky.","103044":"Light, minty, savory aromas of Middle Eastern spices accent basic berry aromas. In the mouth, this is a touch flat. Flavors of herbal, peppery plum and berry fruits finish dry but hollow. The blend is 70% Malbec with 15% each of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.","103049":"Wiry red-berry aromas are lean and stalky smelling. This feels tight with little excess weight or body. Flavors of peppery red fruits come with a broadside shot of oak in front of a short finish.","103111":"Roasted and decidedly earthy on the nose, this has mature aromas of coffee, spice and herb note. A solid fabric of aged tannins and acidity bolster the wild berry and cherry flavors, which finish syrupy and raisiny. A blend of 50% Petit Verdot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Malbec.","103153":"Minty, inky, oaky aromas rest on top of basic berry scents. This is juicy but also reduced in feel. The flavor profile is superficial, with hints of cassis and blackberry. The finish is loamy and heavy, with adequate lift and acidity.","103213":"This creamy, oaky Malbec opens with aromas of rubber and raw oak, although with airing black plum, blackberry and chocolate scents rise up. Full, creamy and jammy in feel, this tastes of black plum, blackberry, chocolate and vanilla. A heady, oaky, sticky finish wraps it up.","103301":"Chunky, earthy aromas of balsam wood, finely aged balsamic vinegar and stewed blackberry yield to a tight drawing palate with hard tannins. This tastes meaty, roasted and more aggressive than El Enemigo's lower-elevation 2013s. A finish with salty toasty oaky notes, big tannins and blazing acidity closes the show. This is Cab Franc with 15% Malbec. Drink through 2023.","103350":"Concentrated aromas of blackberry come with leather and dried-cheese scents. The palate is full in depth and solid in feel, with flavors of creamy oak, medicinality and blackberry. Feels rich, grabby and tastes resiny on the finish, but there's enough solid black fruit to override the oak.","103351":"Light oak aromas blend nicely with white flower scents and peach notes. The palate is round, smooth and honest, with plump flavors of vanilla, pear and melon. Oaky on the finish, then dry and toasty. Nice for a warm-weather Chard.","103361":"Dense and inky on the bouquet, with blueberry as the core fruit aroma and some grass or alfalfa around the edges. Feels blocky and tannic, with sweet, roasted flavors of black fruits that come with a peppery aftertaste. Full on the finish, with coconut and oaky accents.","103385":"Hard, oily, prickly and not impressive by global Sauvignon Blanc standards. The palate deals semisour grapefruit and passion fruit flavors, and the finish is a monotone continuation of the primary flavors.","103386":"Gold in color and about as overoaked as a white wine can be. This blend of Viognier, Chardonnay and Riesling is all resin and barrel spice. It actually offers some sophistication in terms of mouthfeel, but overall it's grossly out of balance and brutally dominated by oak-based aromas and flavors.","103609":"Spicy woody aromas include a note of mushroom. This feels hard and ultratannic, with acidity suggestive of red-wine vinegar. A wiry mix of salt and sour flavors is attached to savory plum fruit, while this pinches down on a drying abrasive finish.","103703":"Like almost every wine in Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec series, Ambrosia is concentrated and deep, with potent aromas of wood smoke, lemon peel, blackberry and tar. This feels layered and plush, while flavors of wild berry, dark spices, coffee and mocha finish with a blast of chocolate and nutmeg. Drink through 2018.","103724":"Earthy, chunky plum aromas get nice accenting from baking spice and leathery notes. This is a fully extracted, full-bodied Malbec with minty, slightly medicinal black-cherry and berry flavors. A bright, dry, spicy finish works well. Drink through 2019.","103790":"Integrated aromas of blackberry, road tar and spice cake set up a palate with pounding tannins and overt tartaric acidity. Earthy blackberry and baking-spice flavors are long and lasting on the finish. This is 40% Malbec, 30% Tempranillo and 30% Syrah.","103823":"Citrus and tropical fruit aromas blend together in clean, attractive fashion. The palate is crisp and cleansing due to firm acidity, while flavors of lime and pithy orange finish tight. This is a clean, clear presentation of Salta Torront\u00e9s.","103825":"Minty blackberry aromas come with a giant scoop of oak and a touch of graphite. This is lively, ripe and a touch acidic, with dark-fruit flavors and freshness courtesy of ringing acids. The finish shows size and moderate sophistication.","103828":"Full, meaty berry aromas come with a savory character that suggests herbs, tar and rubber. Foxy, funky and herbal on the palate, then minty and slightly green late, this is a ripped, big, gangly wine made by Australians in Argentina.","103875":"This Cabernet-led blend has leafy, stalky, dried-out aromas of rubbery berry and compost. It feels raw and rubbery; leafy red-berry flavors are roasted and stalky. It finishes with a mixture of burnt and green flavors.","103887":"The color of this Malbec and the legs it gives off help separate it from the pack. A plush nose shows unabsorbed oak and char along with deep berry and cassis notes. Total saturation on the palate matches the nose, and this tastes of chocolate, mocha, wood spice and rich berry fruits. Oak is currently speaking the loudest on the finish. Drink through 2023.","103969":"A full bouquet includes aromas of licorice, tire rubber, dried cheese and ripe plum and berry fruits. Flush, pulpy and fruity in the mouth, this Cab Franc shows bold boysenberry, currant, plum, spice and tea flavors. On the finish, this is smooth, with good flow and moderate tannins. Drink through 2020.","103972":"Boysenberry and raspberry aromas are not simply dark, ripe and macho, but instead show herbal accents along with floral notes and cardamom. This is old vines Malbec with particular flavors of herbal, brushy berry and plum. On the finish, oaky spice, toast and coffee flavors keep the momentum going. Drink through 2021.","103973":"Cool, herbal aromas of tomato leaf, oregano and beef stew set up a chewy palate with grabby tannins. A mix of savory spices and minty, baked berry flavors end with peppery notes, chunky weight and a tough of heat. Drink through 2022.","103977":"Blackberry and prune aromas show herbal notes and a hint of dried leaf. Medium-full in size and friendly in feel, this has moderate acidity that lends freshness. Gritty, peppery black-fruit flavors finish with an echo of licorice and dark spice. Drink through 2021.","104081":"Prune, raisin and gamy black-fruit aromas fold in a note of iodine. This Uco Valley Malbec features tough but manageable tannins in front of a savory tasting palate with roasted plum and berry flavors. A note of salt lends complexity to a rubbery, tannic finish. Drink through 2023.","104087":"Concentrated aromas of blackberry and iodine are moderately complex. A tight layered palate with juicy acidity propels toasty yet bright flavors of black cherry and plum towards a finish with juicy acidity and natural spicy flavors. Drink through 2021.","104150":"Tropical aromas are a tiny bit grassy and oily. In the mouth, this is acidic and tangy, while lime and green-herb flavors are snappy. Crisp citric acidity creates sizzle on a racy finish.","104185":"Crisp up front, but not overly aromatic or fruity. Feels kind of thick and chewy, with gummy, sweet berry flavors that suggest cherry and plum. Feels a little cloying and cooked on the finish, especially for a young 2011.","104193":"Reedy and green on the nose, then choppy and clipped on the palate. For a full-priced Malbec, this is lacking in ripeness, body and finesse; it's prickly and limited, with green bean, rhubarb and cranberry flavors. Not bad but underwhelming for $33.","104363":"Crisp grapefruit and celery aromas set up a round palate with a pulpy texture. Flavors of scallion, citrus peel and grape skins finish citrusy on one hand and pyrazinic on the other. Possibly of interest, this was fermented and aged in egg-shaped concrete tanks.","104364":"Mild white-fruit aromas come with overt oak scents. A theme of heavy oak is continued on this barrel-driven blend of Tocai, Viognier, Pinot Gris and Chardonnay. Woody flavors outweigh milder spiced apple notes, while this remains oak-dominated on the finish.","104376":"This is an aromatic floral Torront\u00e9s with hints of air freshener and bath oil on the nose. A palate with zesty acidity frames crisp flavors of citrus pulp and peel. A racy finish tastes of lime before showing patented varietal bitterness.","104413":"Dense mossy aromas of blackberry are slightly murky. Forget about delicacy on the palate, this is full-bodied and clattering. Blackberry, cassis, black cherry and chocolate flavors finish spicy. This is at maximum ripeness. Drink through 2022.","104425":"Top-notch Malbec blended with other varieties gives Corte A a chance at greatness. In its current juvenile state, the wine is fresh, expressive and exotic on the nose, with mineral, licorice and spice in addition to a lot of driving berry character. The core is a touch racy and acidic, so this is no mushy fruit bomb. Instead it is serious wine with a lot of oak, polish and pizzazz.","104443":"Terpenes and other gritty aromas control a nose that's fresh but short on fruit. This blend of 85% Torront\u00e9s and 15% Riesling is made more vital by angular citric acidity. Mildly pyrazinic green flavors are offset by passion fruit and lychee notes prior to a crisp, racy finish.","104602":"A fine value among moderately aged Malbecs. Smells like a well-grilled steak along with earthy berry and dry oak. Feels fresh and pure, with proper balance and a lively mix of toast, coconut, blackberry, spice and textured tannins. Compact and just right on the finish. 500 cases made; excellent for under $20.","104609":"Opens with lovely blackberry and herb aromas that suggest richness and ripeness but not overt weight. It feels lush and deep, and tastes totally pleasant and easy, with black fruit, toast and pepper flavors. A thorough and balanced blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Syrah.","104632":"Dark, extracted and woody almost to an extreme, this opens with resiny aromas of raw oak, coconut, vanilla and prune. A palate with pinching, hard tannins is fierce, with heavily oaked flavors of roasted blackberry feeding into a finish with dominant woodspice and resin flavors. Drink through 2020.","104638":"Reduced aromas of iodine, latex and blackberry lead to a tannic, grabby palate with baked blackberry, licorice and rooty flavors. A warm, stewy, earthy finish is where grabby tannins dominate. This is a bold, powerful wine that could benefit from some cellaring time.","104647":"This is Chardonnay with small amounts of Pinot Grigio and Viognier. The nose is nutty, oily and low on fruit. In the mouth, it's racy and citrusy in character. Flavors of orange, papaya and passion fruit are basic, while the finish is fresh and juicy, with tart flavors.","104648":"Dusty plum, prune and leafy notes appear on a plump but somewhat flat nose. This is jammy and chunky in feel, with flavors of stewed berry fruits and herbal hints. Syrupy notes and a fig character add weight to an oaky finish.","104654":"Waxy, floral white-fruit aromas are tropical in style. This feels citrusy, with some pulpiness to the texture. Tangerine, orange and nectarine flavors finish tangy and citric, with one-dimensional juiciness.","104661":"Roasted, earthy aromas of herbs and tomato play off red-berry scents. This wine is full in body and feel, with earthy, baked flavors of red plum and red currant. Acidity rises up on the finish, which otherwise shows vanilla oak and raw tannins.","104662":"In this hot vintage, the wine seems narrow and reduced on the nose and palate. A collapsed structure shows density and jammy flavors of leafy berry, herbs and spice. The finish feels spent but offers tobacco and earth notes.","104792":"Quiet aromas of dried red fruits and Band-Aid include a hint of spice. A lively palate is light to medium in body, while dried cherry and plum flavors are spicy on the finish, with punchy acidity. This emphasizes elegance over weight and power.","104924":"Raspberry and cherry aromas are mild while not stirring much excitement. This feels a bit raw and tannic, but it's got enough body to hold up. Berry and plum flavors finish with hints of spice and chocolate.","104936":"This is typical, textbook Torront\u00e9s with tropical aromas of lime and orange peel. Citrusy acidity creates a refreshing palate feel, while tangerine, lime and lychee flavors conclude in a cleansing, non-oily fashion.","104937":"Wiry plum and raspberry aromas are jumpy and a touch candied. This feels bulky and grapy, with an obtuse body. Salty lightly herbal plum and berry flavors end with a touch of heat along with herbal leftovers.","104947":"Big, blocky black-fruit aromas are reduced and potent. This is quite chunky and extracted in feel, with jammy gritty blackberry and plum flavors that are mildly herbal and simmer with heat and heft on the finish.","104948":"A grassy, herbal element is up front on the nose of this Amarone-style blend done in conjunction with Allegrini of the the Veneto (Italy). In the mouth, it's round as a ball, with syrupy richness. Ripe sticky berry and plum flavors finish chewy with residual stickiness.","104952":"Opens with lemony aromas before blackberry settles in. Feels regular and rolls along a straight plane: Crisp flavors of raspberry and black plum lead to a snappy finish that's just long enough and contains chocolate and vanilla flavors.","104958":"Oily and almondy on the nose, but also layered and stacked. Feels lively, jumpy and pumped full of acidity, then tastes of classic lychee and green melon. Full and driving, with citrusy zest to the tail end.","104972":"A foxy-smelling, juicy, jammy Cabernet with wild berry and sweet oak aromas setting up a forward-feeling palate with plum, berry, sweet oak and resiny flavors. Presents itself as balanced and above average but doesn't go beyond that.","105045":"A very good, heavily oaked Malbec that exudes clove and hickory notes before settling on aromas of earthy fruit and cheesy leather. The palate feels flush and tannic, with accents of clove and cumin and a secondary berry flavor. It ends with touches of barrel spice and resin.","105063":"A consistent Torront\u00e9s, with tropical and exotic aromas of green melon, lychee and bath oil. It feels round despite sporting nice acids, while flavors of green apple, lychee, melon and cardamom work well in front of a long, sweet, pithy finish.","105074":"Powerful, pure and tightly wound, meaning it's a candidate for short-term cellaring, say 2\u20135 years. Smells ripe and fruity, with blackberry, cola and coconut resulting in a spot-on nose. Concentrated and juicy, with a strong constitution and potent plum, berry and cassis flavors. Toasty and lightly oaky on the finish; 73% Malbec and 27% Cabernet Sauvignon.","105078":"Without doubt the most full and complete Chardonnay from Argentina that this critic has tried. It smells lush and toasty, with elegant apple and pear aromas. The mouthfeel is rich and balanced, while flavors of baked apple, vanilla cream and woodspice are endearing. Long and flavorful on the finish, and not overoaked. A serious Chardonnay to drink now.","105137":"Initial rubbery, the oaky and smoky aromas give way to blueberry and plum scents. Hard tannins are cut by juicy acidity, while this tastes of blackberry, dark plum and bacon. Persistent hard-driving tannins are abrasive on the finish, which holds onto racy acidity and core berry fruit flavors.","105347":"Dry and short on fruit, with strong barrel aromas of pepper, cinnamon and resin. In the mouth, there's more wood than fruit, leaving heat, vanilla and spice to overshadow mild strawberry\/raspberry flavors. What's best about the wine is the mouthfeel; it's round and creamy, with length. Anyone averse to forward oak should steer clear of Utop\u00eda.","105351":"Melted fudge and asphalt are draped on this young wine's bouquet. Given that opening, a palate of black plum and cassis isn't surprising. Feelwise, it's a touch rough and tannic, which is probably to be expected. Turns more herbal the more you sniff and swirl.","105375":"A little heavy and teetering toward overripeness, but it holds the line despite issuing aromas of raisin, heat, leather and marinated meat. The mouth is sweet and big-boned, with good tannic structure. Tastes a touch roasted and\/or burnt on the finish. Gets it more right than wrong.","105376":"Lychee and melon aromas dance with sweeter scents of air freshener and perfume. The palate is zesty and driven, with narrow tangerine and orange flavors. Flashy Torrontes is what this is; it delivers the goods but doesn't step too hard on the gas pedal. Drink now.","105396":"Exuberant maple and coconut aromas are forward and announce aggressive oak. In the mouth, this beefy Syrah is full but fresh, with resiny richness offset by cutting tannins and acidity. Blueberry and blackberry flavors are oaky and bring related vanilla and licorice notes in front of a lush finish.","105573":"he bouquet smells jammy and not that exciting. In the mouth, freshness takes over, but the acidity is hard. Flavors of wild berry are spicy and continue into the finish, with oak making itself known.","105574":"Rooty aromas are ripe on one hand and lighty herbal on the other. This feels focused and crisp, with good structure and tannins in front of raspberry and cassis flavors. For the most part this is on the money, even with a finish that's flat in feel and earthy in flavor. The blend is 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Malbec.","105641":"This meaty, ripe Syrah is smoky and deep on the nose, with lusty berry aromas. The palate is tannic but supported by bold, fleshy blackberry flavors backed by maple, vanilla and burnt toast. Caramel richness makes its way onto the finish, which is rocky and tannic but tastes good. This value Syrah was built for grilled meat.","105643":"Smoky aromas of bacon and rubber blend with cherry and plum scents to form a good bouquet. This has a fair, fresh mouthfeel with tannic grip. Leafy flavors of plum and red currant are accented by spicy, dry, woody notes, while the finish is lightly green and oaky, with lasting spice.","105644":"Jammy, reduced aromas of cassis, blueberry and animal hide lead to a juicy, fresh palate that's not too thick or concentrated. Blackberry and blueberry flavors are lightly peppered, while the finish is quick and light for Malbec. This is a new wine that aims at freshness and simple fruit more than power and weight.","105645":"A fairly oaky bouquet with overt wood grain, vanilla and creamy aromas includes cherry and plum scents. A mostly fresh, choppy palate is a bit rough, while currant and spiced-plum flavors end with woody, medicinal accents. Overall this works well.","105661":"Cola, blackberry and dusty aromas amount to something nice and inviting. Cab Franc is new to the Broquel lineup, and this is lush, bold and fruity in style, with blackberry, black cherry and mocha flavors in front of a toasty, full-throttle finish.","105677":"Cherry and plum aromas are ripe, sweet and inviting. There's plenty of body and roundness to this Bonarda, while exotic blueberry and boysenberry flavors finish fresh, with a light herbal aftertaste. Overall this shows lots of fruit and good balance.","105698":"Fruity, pure and smooth on the nose, and maybe more dry and leathery than the blasting Nicasia vineyard wine. The palate has a deep, classy elegance along with power, and the flavors run toward huge black fruits, coffee and chocolate. Finishes dark, long and minerally, and overall it's yet another awesome top-flight Malbec from this world-class winery. Drink now through 2014.","105702":"Young, fiery and rugged on the nose, but with exotic notes that suggest Middle Eastern and Asian herbs and spices. Like all Cobos Malbecs, this is big, chewy, brawny and a touch medicinal, with powerful dark fruit flavors, particularly black cherry, and a good deal of licorice, chocolate and overall richness. Handles its 15% alcohol better than many heavyweights; drink now through 2013.","105758":"Tarry aromas of blackberry and freshly applied asphalt set up a full-bodied palate with sandpaper tannins. Blackberry and toast flavors taste a little burnt, while an oak-based blackened element is present on a stout finish. Drink this blocky and lusty Malbec through 2023.","105765":"Black in color, this smells of olive, eucalyptus and tarry berry, much like you'd get from a high-end Chilean red. An extracted massive palate is dense and layered, while this tastes of salty black plum and black currant. A toasty smooth finish with mild tannins is herbal and balsamic. Drink through 2021.","105770":"Potent, inky aromas of blackberry and licorice reflect this beefy Malbec's opaque black color. In the mouth, this is energetic and not just heavy and extracted. Lightly salted black-fruit flavors are lifted by acidity, while this finishes deep and strong. Drink through 2022.","105868":"Oily and almondy on the nose, but also layered and stacked. Feels lively, jumpy and pumped full of acidity, then tastes of classic lychee and green melon. Full and driving, with citrusy zest to the tail end.","105874":"Lots of fruit is apparent right from the start, with cassis, raspberry, red plum and cotton candy aromas. Lively as can be, but under control, with huge berry flavors touched up by oaky chocolate and vanilla. Not complex but definitely all-out with the berry fruit.","105959":"Lime and green melon aromas are a bit less than clean and pure, and the palate serves up a pile of jalape\u00f1o and bell pepper, with some lime in the background. Short on the finish, and kind of dilute.","105969":"Rustic and stemmy, with burnt, nutty aromas leading to a thick palate of stemmy black fruit flavors. Herbal, tannic and stemmy throughout, so at least there's continuity between the nose, palate and finish.","105971":"Rough and stemmy smelling, and sort of scratchy. The palate is acceptable but that's about it, with creamy, sweet, wayward berry flavors. Finishes medicinal and a bit weedy. Similar in quality to the \u201807 Urban Tempranillo.","105975":"A baked, sweet, candied Malbec with a gritty, sugary mouthfeel and sweet, zappy cherry and plum flavors. Hot and breaks down on the finish. Rudimentary.","105977":"Jammy and dark, with sweet, candied, offbeat aromas. Heavy in the mouth, with baked plum and berry flavors and then a reduced, short finish. Thick almost to the point of cloying. A strange wine.","106040":"Starts with a nice mix of peppery, live-fruit aromatics along with earth. Has good weight and balance, while the flavors of plum, raspberry and black cherry are mellow and touched up by hints of spice, vanilla and herbs. Shows good character and composition.","106052":"Dark berry and meaty fruit on the nose, with plum and blackberry aromas. The palate is zestier, with bright acidity tempering any weight. The finish is solid, with nothing off or outlandish to consider. A good, solid, concentrated Syrah without a whole lot of varietal character.","106161":"Rustic, gritty berry aromas come with notes of plastic, oak grain and grass. This is raw, chewy and tannic in feel, with roasted, spicy berry flavors that run low on ripeness. A salt-and-pepper finish includes herbal berry flavors and sticky tannins.","106164":"Peach-pit and stone-fruit aromas are dry and a touch bitter. Because this is so young, it's juicy and minerally in its current state, with citric acidity in the driver's seat. Nectarine and tangerine flavors finish fresh but simple.","106166":"Cherry and currant aromas come with soupy notes and a blast of animal fur. Although this is aggressive and choppy on the palate, it's loaded with grapy, slightly stewed berry and plum flavors. A similar tasting finish turns more rough and warm with airing.","106410":"Cool briary plum and blackberry aromas show lactic, creamy oak, which is nothing unusual for Cobos. Plump, dense and saturated in the mouth, this block-selection Malbec is extremely ripe, with medicinal black fruit and raisiny flavors touched up by mocha and peppery spice. An oaky, spicy finish is par for the course. Drink through 2021.","106460":"Dark in color, then jammy on the nose, this oaky specimen has heavily extracted berry aromas. In the mouth, there's a level of freshness offset by heavy fruit content. Flavors of berry and plum are chocolaty up front and finish with spice, pepper and additional chocolate richness. Drink through 2018.","106463":"The wine is called 40 Barrels and every bit of those barrels is crawling on this Malbec-Cab blend. For starters, it smells more like hickory than fruit. Soon blackberry and prune aromas and flavors get into the game, but even then the back palate and finish are resiny. Some citric acidity in the center keeps it keen but raises questions about balance.","106464":"Blueberry with snap is the way to describe the bouquet on this fresh and spunky young Malbec. The flavors are sweet and intense, just like grapes off the vine. It doesn't offer much complexity but at the same time it doesn't taste confected or flawed in any way.","106579":"This smells familiar and solid, with blackberry, licorice and dark cherry aromas. It feels medium bodied for a high-end Argentine Cabernet, with healthy acidity and probing tannins. The flavors of blackberry and raspberry finish crisp and slightly citric.","106851":"Fiery and clipped on the nose, but then it settles onto red fruits and candy notes. The palate shows good grip and a proper but basic feel, with generic red berry and currant flavors. Solid on the finish; good in a common way.","106856":"Syrupy smelling on first take, with bacon, rubber and herb aromas. The palate has a healthy, full feel and a mixed bag of not fully connected flavors including herbs, spice, dried fennel and sweet berry fruits. A somewhat odd tasting blend of 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Merlot.","107029":"Deep, dark and charred on the nose, this features campfire and black cherry aromas. It feels fresh, alert and snappy for being so dark and ripe, with blackberry and padded oak flavors. It's layered and a touch creamy on the finish. A modern, powerful Malbec to drink now\u20132016.","107053":"Smells earthy and baked, with bulk to the bouquet and a gaseous quality that blows off with time. Feels chunky, grabby and tannic, with fully ripe flavors of jammy blackberry. Pours on the heft and broad tannins, but comes up a little short in the nuance and character categories. Drink now.","107058":"There's a ton of oak on this Malbec, but there's also enough body and richness to handle it. The wine smells minty and dark, with shoe polish and chocolate aromas. Tight and acidic on the tongue, with an oak-led set of flavors that includes coconut, vanilla and butter along with blackberry. Prickly and electric due to high acidity, but quite good as a whole.","107065":"A really good and upright blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Syrah that exhibits composure along with nice berry and pastry aromas. Bright and zesty in the mouth, with boysenberry, blueberry and pulse to the palate. Long, driving and steady on the finish.","107105":"Quite herbal and foxy on the nose, with char and olive aromas. The palate is thick, jammy and clumsy, with bittersweet notes of stewed berry and blackberry syrup. A huge, muscular wine that's really ripe and untamed.","107106":"Grapey and foxy, with green, minty aromas and a hollow center. The palate is bulky, heavy and tannic, while the flavors are strained and grapey. Sweet and incomplete; grapey but not in harmony.","107108":"Raspberry, plum and cherry aromas become more thin, cheesy and leathery with time. The palate is hard and narrow, with sheer flavors of generic raspberry and plum. Clacky and rough feeling on the finish.","107109":"Jammy and a bit scratchy on the nose, and also sort of dull and earthy. In the mouth, it's tangy and citrusy, bordering on sour tasting, with pie cherry, plum and light savory notes. Finishes red and juicy, but with a tomato accent.","107112":"Oily and blowsy smelling, with almondy aromas and a pinch of citrus. The palate is heavy and chunky, with sweet, overripe flavors of pineapple and peach. Sweet and stalky on the finish.","107116":"Tobacco and mint aromas cloud the wine's bouquet, while the palate starts out rough and scratchy, with a heavy dose of grape-skin tannin. Upon airing it offers more berry fruit but also salty, leathery finishing flavors. And the tannins never really cease.","107117":"Stemmy and lightly green on the nose, with raspberry and plum filling in the blanks. The palate is a bit hollow and empty, with herbal plum and berry flavors. Not bad but it does shows stemminess and raspy qualities.","107424":"Leafy tomato, dried cherry and baked plum aromas cover most ends of the Pinot spectrum. This feels round, ripe and a touch tannic, while oaky flavors of vanilla and chocolate dominate, ending with more than a dash of wood spice.","107498":"This pitch-black Malbec opens with aromas of raisin, blackberry, cassis and vanilla. The palate exhibits a tight muscular grip, while flavors of mocha, chocolate, prune and cassis finish with complex hints of leather and salt. Drink this massive offering from 2018\u20132026.","107499":"One of Argentina's few high-end Merlots, this opens with maple, toasty oak and deep berry aromas. With 9% Petit Verdot and Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc mixed in, this feels juicy, ripped and eminently healthy. Flavors of coffee, blackberry and cherry are deep and pure, while this avoids being overweight by tipping the scales at 13.9% abv. Drink through 2022.","107556":"Earthy plum and red-berry aromas are suggestive of tomato. This kicks around the palate with lively acidity and hard tannins. Roasted, savory plum and oak flavors taste spicy and peppery, with fruit pushed to the fringes.","107575":"Crisp cherry and plum aromas are gritty. This Malbec shows wiry acidity but the palate is still a touch soupy. Salty plum and oak spice flavors include notes of clove and pepper. As a whole, this is oaky and fairly heavy.","107579":"Earthy aromas of stewed plum and burnt leaves come in front of a drawing, raw palate with fresh acidity. Roasted, savory plum and berry flavors are fairly standard. This wine is dense but still lively on the finish.","107584":"This is a hot, earthy Malbec with cover-up oak on the nose. A high-acid palate is drying and hard, with narrow, salty berry flavors and a peppery tasting, scratchy finish.","107600":"Blueberry, plum and cardamom aromas include a whiff of wood smoke. A balanced palate has energy along with brambly berry and chocolate flavors. A chewy, solid finish is good but less lively than the palate.","107612":"Minty, roasted berry aromas open this well-built Cabernet that's packed with plum, raspberry and wood-spice flavors. There's nothing complicated about this lively, oaky wine that runs long on the finish.","107763":"A draft of menthol and aromas of chocolate and mossy fruit work pretty nicely on the nose, while the palate is superripe, a bit candied and accented by spice and coffee. This is a strong starter, though it falls off a little on the finish.","107766":"Pineapple and apple aromas are fairly attractive and fresh, as is the light, wet and zippy palate, which shows mostly citrus and apple flavors. The finish is mild and clean, and overall the wine delivers clarity and a dominant citrus profile.","107774":"Big and boisterous, as if you're sniffing a bed of coal, menthol and macerated black fruit. The palate is sun-drenched and juicy, but not what you'd call elevated. And the finish mixes savory flavors with tight tannins. A good red wine that bears little semblance to Old World Syrah.","107789":"Dark and incredibly concentrated, with earth, black fruits, mint and exotic side notes. It's stout and tannic, but also rich and pure, with monster black fruit flavor and powerful coffee, toast and length on the finish. A smashing wine that's huge but delicious. Drink now through 2017.","107813":"This is bright in color and loud on the nose, where it's distinctly medicinal and minty, with a strong green component. The palate doesn't differ; it's gritty and heavy in feel, with forced, jammy flavors of mint, grass and bitter black fruits.","107818":"This is herbal, burnt and stalky smelling, then raw and herbal tasting, with weedy notes and a scratchy finish.","107946":"Interest-stirring aromas of tea, stewed berry fruits, vanilla and oak segue into a chewy, dense palate with bulk. Savory, lightly herbal berry flavors are draped with oak character, while this Malbec tastes of grainy oak and toast on the finish. Drink through 2021.","107953":"Rich aromas of molasses, chocolate and fig paste announce a ripe, thick Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon blend. On the palate, this is grabby, intense and oaky. Flavors of oak grain, graphite, chocolate and berry fruits finish saturated and heavy, lacking elegance.","107981":"Light, airy aromas of tropical fruits and kaffir lime are modest. In the mouth, the wine is tight and chalky. Flavors of lime, lychee and green apple finish firm, with nice acidity and a slight oily character.","108032":"This mighty Malbec opens with toasty oak, a pinch of sawdust and perfumed black fruit, vanilla and spice notes. The palate is lofty and rich, with beautiful berry and plum flavors. A smooth, sexy wine from the Uco Valley that shows that vineyard sourcing absolutely matters. Best wine from Alta Vista to date.","108047":"Still the king of South American Pinot Noir, Chacra's \u201c55\u201d offers a beautiful amalgam of dusty Middle Eastern spice aromas along with raspberry, cherry and cocoa notes. It's a finessed but forceful (read: high-alcohol) Pinot with penetrating black cherry, plum and chocolate flavors, and the finish is long but hot in its youth. Doesn't lack for much of anything. Best from late 2010 through 2013.","108053":"Initially, this smells green, with aromas akin to salad. With time, riper berry notes and oak rise up. In the mouth, this has a choppy feel and edgy freshness, while flavors of stalky, lightly green berry fruits finish with an oaky, minty character.","108164":"The hazy aromas of honeyed white fruits are a touch gaseous. It feels plump and nice, with soft, almost flat melon flavors. It tastes similar on the finish, showing little evolution from the palate.","108192":"This meaty, ripe Syrah is smoky and deep on the nose, with lusty berry aromas. The palate is tannic but supported by bold, fleshy blackberry flavors backed by maple, vanilla and burnt toast. Caramel richness makes its way onto the finish, which is rocky and tannic but tastes good. This value Syrah was built for grilled meat.","108194":"Smoky aromas of bacon and rubber blend with cherry and plum scents to form a good bouquet. This has a fair, fresh mouthfeel with tannic grip. Leafy flavors of plum and red currant are accented by spicy, dry, woody notes, while the finish is lightly green and oaky, with lasting spice.","108199":"Jammy, reduced aromas of cassis, blueberry and animal hide lead to a juicy, fresh palate that's not too thick or concentrated. Blackberry and blueberry flavors are lightly peppered, while the finish is quick and light for Malbec. This is a new wine that aims at freshness and simple fruit more than power and weight.","108200":"A fairly oaky bouquet with overt wood grain, vanilla and creamy aromas includes cherry and plum scents. A mostly fresh, choppy palate is a bit rough, while currant and spiced-plum flavors end with woody, medicinal accents. Overall this works well.","108225":"The waxy, dusty aromas of apple are calm and regular. It feels a bit flat, with oaky flavors of apple, melon, vanilla and resin. The finish feels resiny too, but overall it's good in a regular, popular style.","108264":"A crisp, focused nose consisting of lemon peel, cedar, dried cheese, blackberry and cassis aromas is encouraging. This Malbec (with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon) is mouth-filling and tight, with firm tannins. Pointed salty flavors of black plum and berry fruits finish with integrated spice and cocoa notes. Drink now through 2024\u2014the longer this sits, the less aggressive and choppy it'll be.","108266":"Mellow earthy aromas of mossy black fruits, vanilla and licorice feed into a smooth palate with moderate depth and layering. Blackened flavors of coffee and dark chocolate accent black-fruit and mushroom notes, while this finishes with prune, pepper and toasty flavors along with a glassy feel. Drink through 2019.","108319":"Opens with warm, baked black fruit aromas and then a wave of woodiness takes control. The palate is round, full and sticky, with beefy but generic black fruit flavors and too much oak. Finishes with vanilla and resin; not a bad wine but needs more balance and fruit.","108320":"A little hard on the nose, with burnt undertones. The palate is hollow in the middle and the wine collapses on itself. As for flavors, look for mildly toasted and creamy white fruits and vanilla.","108323":"A lot of oak. The nose is honeyed and heavy, with too much toast and butter. In the mouth, it's got kicking acids but the flavors are sweet, oaky and veer toward banana. Resiny on the finish; underwhelming for the price.","108328":"Rusty in color, with a mildly mulchy, leafy nose that's also slightly floral and smells of orange peel. Zesty in the mouth, with a lean profile and tart flavors of red cherry, plum and herbs.","108572":"A ripe specimen with baked, earthy aromas that settle with airing. Hits with power and layering along with medicinal, oaky flavors that foist chocolate onto the wine's core black-fruit content. Generous despite some ruggedness and heat to the finish. Malbec with Cab Franc, Cab Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot.","108574":"Dry and balsamic on the bouquet, with earthy, mellow berry aromas that do not push. In the mouth, it comes across charred and roasted, with baked, chocolaty, leafy accents on top of core red fruit flavors. Turns more leafy and charred as it unfolds, with a forward finish. Malbec with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot.","108585":"This small-lot Bonarda is one of Argentina's bright examples of the variety. It's ripe but brushy smelling, with chocolate and vanilla aromas blending with blackberry and herbs. Feels super fresh and juicy, with boysenberry, blackberry and chocolaty flavors. Very good overall.","108695":"Among Cobos's high-end 2011 Malbecs, this one comes across as the most complete, layered and complex of the group. Aromas of fine oak and pencil lead augment blackberry and baked plum scents. The mouthfeel is smooth, round and rich, while flavors of tea, savory spices and black fruits dance long into the night. A ripe but not too heavy finish is earthy, calm and complete. Drink through 2019.","108984":"Edgy from the start, this blend of Cabernet, Malbec and Petit Verdot smells of asphalt and burnt toast. Pinching in feel, with hard tannins, this tastes roasted, leafy and like carob. Overall the flavors struggle to avoid earthy and rustic.","109003":"Light, lemony aromas work for the most part. This feels full, even creamy. Flavors of papaya, melon and apple finish with a note of pineapple. The longer this sits, the more soft and tropical it becomes.","109042":"Leathery black-fruit aromas are not overly expressive but draw you in. This feels bright and juicy, with jumpy acidity. Flavors of boysenberry and blackberry finish long and fresh, with choppy acidity.","109110":"The question is how much oak can you handle? If you like a heavily toasted, resiny type of full-bodied Chardonnay, add two or three points. If you absolutely hate that style, then subtract a few points. For those of us in between, look for resiny, toasty, heavy aromas on top of a thick, chewy palate full of baked apple and tons of wood spice. One-dimensional but well made.","109163":"This deep-colored Malbec hits hard with cola and blackberry aromas. It's a muscular, oaky specimen on the palate, with noticeable tannins. Flavors of wood and toast are in the lead, followed by black fruits, clove and lemon rind. Drink now through 2016.","109172":"Smoky berry aromas come with notes of rubber band and earth. A chunky, full-bodied, rubbery-feeling palate comes next, followed by herbal flavors of blackberry and blueberry. Prune, blueberry and hard spice flavors finish in Bordeaux style.","109217":"This bulky bullish Malbec opens with big tarry aromas that go heavy on the oak. The palate is tannic like the clack-clack of heels on a tile floor. This tastes earthy, oaky and like blackberry, while the finish echoes with those same flavors. Drink through 2023.","109218":"Dry spicy aromas accent woodsy berry scents. A tight focused palate jabs with acidity and poking tannins, while this tastes of lightly herbal cherry and berry fruit. Spicy flavors on a healthy finish help this along.","109228":"Piercing aromas of char and creosote are like a laser pop surrounded by a note of blackberry. This is raw, tannic and hard on the palate. Chunky berry flavors are heavily oaked, while this is jammy in feel and tastes of blueberry on the finish. Drink through 2021.","109259":"This wine takes you on a trip to an outer wine world where deep, cushioned berry aromas come with exotic perfumes, bath oils and crushed flower petals. It's ultrasaturated and jammy, but not clunky or heavy. This tastes like a storm of blackberry, espresso and Swiss chocolate, while black spices and length bring up the rear. A blend of 50% Malbec, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cab Franc; drink now\u20132017.","109316":"Right away, this smells smooth and complete, with a proper mix of berry fruit, oak and earthy aromas. This is Salentein winemaker Jos\u00e9 Galante's personal wine, and it's juicy on the palate and doesn't overreach. Blackberry, boysenberry and salty, meaty notes finish with a persistent dose of salt, which should make this all the more appropriate when served with beef. Drink through 2022.","109450":"Flat on the nose, then almost identical on the palate, this blend of Malbec, Syrah and Bonarda tastes grassy, lightly green and weedy. Cherry and berry flavors are weak. Tasted twice with similar results.","109452":"Sawdust characterizes the nose of this strained ros\u00e9. The palate is heavy, resiny and low on acidity, while flavors of forced wood and cream are devoid of fruit.","109539":"The nose on this Malbec-Merlot from Salta is raw and saucy, with more brawn and rusticity than elegance. A compact grabby palate is intense, with herbal plum and hefty berry notes that mellow on a chunky lightly herbal finish.","109556":"This is nice and hints at greater things, but ultimately it's more modest and fluffy than substantive. Aromas of oak resin, baked apple and vanilla introduce a palate with mild acidity and not much structure. Vanilla, caramel, banana and honey- dew flavors finish soft.","109567":"Much like the previous vintage of La Violeta, this is a fabulous Malbec with depth, density and power to spare. The bouquet yields marzipan, cola, fine leather, char and rich berry aromas. That sets up a palate with impeccable structure and huge flavors of beef jerky, mocha, black fruits and spice. The finish is massive and loaded, with licorice and mocha flavors. Drink now\u20132018. Only 100 cases made, with 50 imported into the U.S.","109581":"Until now, Tapiz has been a value-driven brand with no wine priced above $20. This outstanding Malbec shows that they've been holding something back. Black Tears is ripe and handsome, with almost everything in its perfect place. It's a hard-driving wine with blackberry, vanilla and coconut aromas and flavors in front of a chewy, tannin-rich finish with the mildest note of raisin. Drink this unbridled stud now through 2017.","109806":"Dark, dense and ripe from the start, this New World-style Cab Franc is showing raisin, vanilla and foresty aromas prior to a lush soft palate. Flavors of raisin, chocolate and blackberry are on the cusp of overripe and desiccated, while this finishes with flavors of licorice, peppercorn, beef jerky and chocolate. Drink this bulky soft-bodied red now through 2018.","109827":"Deep berry, cola, mint and leather aromas are classy and not overdone. Feels lush and deep in the mouth, with blatant ripeness and toasty, oaky flavors of cola, coconut and blackberry. Finishes big but not that long or complex. Drink now through 2013; Malbec with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.","109832":"Graphite and lead pencil aromas mix with toasty berry scents. It's solid and textured in the mouth, with creamy oak flavors alongside sawdust, milk chocolate and sweet berry notes. Deep and solid on the finish, but it trails behind Adrianna wines from recent vintages.","109833":"A sniff is rewarded with sandalwood, dry spice and thick, jammy berry aromas. It's concentrated and well integrated on the palate, with ultraripe and sweet flavors of coconut, vanilla cream and berry fruit. Seems a touch flat and candied on the finish, with a final blast of sweetness.","109836":"Quite bright, sweet and fruity, with a hint of cherry candy and blackberry on the bouquet and then a juicy, fresh palate with mild chocolate, raspberry and proper texture. For $11 this wine is more than competent; it's very good. 50,000 cases made.","109865":"Just when you think Alta Vista has gotten everything it can from Temis (see the 2012), this comes along to reset the benchmark. Ripe, round and lush on the nose, with full-force blackberry and prune aromas, this shows titanic grip, depth and ripeness on the palate. Flavors of raisin, chocolate and blackberry finish with hefty tannins and a smear of mocha flavor. Drink from 2018\u20132026.","109959":"Salentein's wines have never been better than over the last few vintages. This Malbec-heavy blend is rich, with aromatic notes of raisin, prune, licorice and almond candy. A full, tannic and slightly bumpy palate holds impressive flavors of cassis, black plum, blackberry, toast and peppercorn. On the finish, coffee, toast, mocha, licorice and cassis flavors are deep and delicious. Drink through 2026.","109989":"Right away this blend is clicking. Aromas of blackberry and cassis are clean and well presented. A full, free-flowing palate is in balance and showing only modest tannic grab. Blackberry, toast and chocolate flavors finish bold and a little choppy. Drink through 2020.","110035":"Compact, inky aromas of blackberry, balsamic notes, earth and smoke are complete. This is lively yet full-bodied in feel, with dark, toasty black-fruit flavors that come with hints of chocolate, pepper, herbs and fig. A long, toasty, slightly hot and burning finish keeps this smoldering for a while. Drink through 2018.","110098":"Earthy on first impression, then more vital and modern, with raspberry and plum aromas along with a dose of oak. Full and showing a powerful grip in the mouth, with cassis, black cherry and chocolate flavors. Sweet and very ripe late, with a touch of raisin as it fades away.","110392":"Foresty berry aromas are backed up by baking spice, cola and toasty oak notes on the nose of this chewy, dense, fairly tannic Malbec. Plum and blackberry flavors come with an exotic note of cardamom along with coffee and dry oak. On the finish, this feels resiny and tastes a bit herbal. Drink through 2020.","110399":"Aromas of violet petal and gamy berry fruits come with a strong oak-based whiff of sawdust. This feels blocky and generically big, while saucy berry flavors taste roasted, with a strong hint of clove. On the finish, this remains roasted and saucy tasting.","110423":"Aromas of herbs and desert brush blend with raisiny berry scents. This feels grabby and tannic, while jammy, herbal berry flavors flatten out with airing. A loamy tasting finish loses some intensity and spirit as this settles.","110460":"This creamy, oaky Malbec opens with aromas of rubber and raw oak, although with airing black plum, blackberry and chocolate scents rise up. Full, creamy and jammy in feel, this tastes of black plum, blackberry, chocolate and vanilla. A heady, oaky, sticky finish wraps it up.","110643":"With a bright violet color and jammy boysenberry and black-cherry aromas, this amounts to a fruity, chunky blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. On the palate, blackberry flavors run inky and come with a lot of oak and vanilla. A round, creamy finish is chewy and lush. Drink through 2019.","110744":"Rubber and minerally aromas settle on ripe black plum and berry. In the mouth, this Malbec is firm and fresh, with full-force flavors of blackberry, plum, leather and salt. A strong, steady finish confirms overall quality.","110965":"Earthy and leafy aromas yield to tomato leaf and weighty plum aromas. The palate is full but sharp, with tart, driving pie cherry and herbal flavors. Stays rather hard on the finish, where more tomato rolls out.","110975":"Awfully green and scratchy for a $30 \u201cspecial edition\u201d Malbec. The nose is brambly and rapidly devolves into outright grassy. The palate is narrow and underdeveloped, with reedy, raspy flavors of plum, raspberry and mint. Far from what you'd hope for from a higher-priced wine; 350 cases produced.","110979":"Hard, dark and spicy up front, then clampy, tannic and aggressive feeling, with astringency and bitter, burnt, oaky flavors of black fruits. Finishes hard and tannic, with rubbery heat. A case of more being less; needs to be dialed down.","110980":"Spicy and roasted on the nose, with little that's typical of Cabernet Sauvignon. Astringent like a rubber band across the palate, with roasted, earthy flavors that offer some sweetness but not much else.","111058":"One sniff tells you plenty: there's attractive spice, coffee and leather to go with rich molasses and broad black-fruit aromas. The palate maintains balance due to fine, fresh acidity, and the flavor profile brings mocha, coffee, berry, plum and toast. Delicious, deep, layered and refined. Will age for at least 5\u20136 years, but best from 2012\u20132014.","111070":"Black fruit aromas feature a touch of licorice. Feels lively and alert, with edgy acids and juicy, forward flavors of plum and wild berry. Toasty, integrated and spicy on the finish, with pinches of green and black pepper.","111083":"Opens with berry fruit aromas, density and slightly medicinal notes. Feels bright and lively, with ample acidity pushing toasty, lightly herbal flavors of blackberry and plum. Shows mild spice, licorice and barrel notes on the finish, along with herbal notes. Seems like a very good everyday or value-driven choice.","111100":"Jammy raspberry aromas come with a minerally kick and toastiness. The palate is fresh and delivers pointed acidity in support of toasty berry, herb and licorice flavors. Finishes with a lightly baked and chocolaty note, confirming that this is well-made, value-priced wine.","111105":"This is a superripe Malbec with jammy aromas of raisin and prune that can best be described as \u201cfleshy.\u201d A chunky palate follows the nose in lockstep, and then baked blackberry and chocolate flavors take over. A chubby, jammy finish says drink this soon.","111121":"The nose on this Malbec is loaded with oak and pencil eraser aromas; there's also a raisiny quality to the bouquet. This feels a touch stewy, although strong acidity functions as an offset. Blackberry, licorice and clove flavors come in front of a raw, tight, narrow finish with stomping tannins.","111317":"Aromas of citrus and talcum powder are a bit muddled. This ros\u00e9 of Pinot Gris feels lean, jumpy and juicy, while tangy flavors of citrus and stone fruits finish with a mild spritzy tingle. Other than that, there's not much to this.","111414":"Starts with sulfur and matchstick before turning broad and saucy. The palate is slick and savory, with herbal, meaty blackberry and plum flavors. It's a big, young, extracted Malbec with an equal amount of ups and downs. Thus it falls in the middle of things.","111459":"Murky smelling, with nondescript berry aromas. Ultratannic and hard in the mouth, much like chewing nails. Meanwhile, the flavors run herbal and earthy, with dark fruit carrying things to a hard, tannic finish.","111468":"Foxy cherry and cough drop aromas are not convincing. Feels astringent and tastes tart, with sharp but candied cherry, faux oak and milk chocolate flavors. Blends sour notes with sweet oak, all to little avail.","111477":"Smells grassy, jumpy and foxy, and while it sports a decent feel on the palate, it's herbal and tomatoey in terms of flavor, with a vegetal undertone. Green and oaky on the finish.","111637":"Big blackberry aromas show very little rusticity. Feels full but smooth and balanced, with a nice mix of wild berry, spice and fine herb flavors. Mellow and not pushy on the finish. Really good for Bonarda.","111682":"Rich, lusty aromas of blackberry, graham cracker and coconut are hard-driving in this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot. It's oaky and full of coconut, vanilla, blackberry and toasted marshmallow flavors. Ripe and oaky on the finish, it also offers coffee, mocha and chocolate notes. Drink through 2020.","111696":"Deep and dense from head to toe, this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend opens with heavy, loamy black-fruit aromas along with coconut, graphite, cedar and tobacco scents. A definitively rich and chewy palate is tannic and heady but cushioned, while baked, toasty blackberry flavors come with vanilla and marzipan notes and an inky, chewy, thick finish. Drink through 2019.","111703":"This fruit-driven, minerally Malbec hails from the Altamira section of Mendoza's Uco Valley. Blueberry, cassis and stony aromas feed into a deep, pure palate with plenty to offer. Flavors of cassis, blackberry, peppercorn and exotic spices finish with moderate tannins and flavors of fig and black pepper. Drink through 2019.","111736":"Earthy, fairly deep aromas of black fruits and mellow spices come with plenty of oak. In the mouth, this is fresh in feel and medium in body. Flavors of toasty, creamy oak and related vanilla top berry flavors, while the finish is mild, smooth and woody.","111770":"This no-oak Petit Verdot is rusty and turning vegetal and herbal, with tomato-based flavors and a burnt-out finish.","111886":"Regular but inviting, with good berry aromas and only a modicum of baked-fruit grit to the nose. The palate is solid and fruity, with lively, grapey berry and black-cherry flavors. Finishes smooth, with chocolate notes. Easygoing, simple Malbec from San Juan province.","111896":"Fairly stemmy on the nose, with rhubarb and raspberry pushing things to the red fruit side. The palate feel is dry and basic, while the flavors of cherry and raspberry are candied and sweet. Somewhat sugary on the finish, but good for the little-known region of Catamarca.","111929":"Dark, minty, inky aromas of blackberry are rugged. Same for the palate, which is pinched and rubbery, with grabby tannins. Flavors of toasted, blackened berry fruits are chocolaty and well oaked. Raw heat and minty, coffee flavors rev up the finish on this Malbec-led blend.","111937":"A unique rendition of the variety, this is smoky and charred to the max, with nothing else escaping from the bouquet. In the mouth, the acidity is ripping and tight, creating purity and elegance. Super smoky, toasty flavors of green apple and citrus fruits finish woody in flavor but chiseled in feel. Drink through 2017.","112026":"Dark and brooding on the nose, with mint, menthol, beefy fruit and coconut for sweetness. Feels choppy and more acidic than expected, with heavy flavors of coconut, toast and blackberry. Toasty, herbal and slightly scratchy on the finish.","112035":"Dark and leathery up front, with a dusting of nutmeg and sawdust. Feels a bit grabby and resiny, but it's boasting enough acidity to push things through. Flavors of cassis, berry and herbs are normal and nice, while the finish is warm and chunky. Good Cabernet for the price.","112075":"Blackberry, oak, spice and chocolate aromas are dealt in equal parts. This feels ripe and fairly plush. Flavors of burnt toast, black pepper and charred wood lead secondary fruit notes across the palate and onto the finish.","112123":"Blueberry and green-herb aromas give this Malbec-led blend a grassy bouquet. Jammy and chewy in the mouth, this tastes like raisin, molasses and herbal blueberry. Minty, herbal notes dominate the finish.","112138":"Gritty, rubbery plum and berry aromas are also a touch smoky. This is solid in mouthfeel, with plum, cherry, spice and mild salty flavors. A dry finish with plenty of woodspice character is a bit hot.","112141":"Woodsy raisin and cassis aromas are closed and a bit chemical. This feels solid, round and resiny, with wood-driven flavors of raspberry, plum and oak-related spices. Dry and resiny feeling on the finish.","112144":"With an ominous rusty orange color and saucy, rubbery aromas, you'd think this would be over the hill, or even DOA. But in the mouth, this is juicy and holding steady. Light flavors of apricot and tangerine finish zesty, dry, citrusy and a touch bitter. Drink immediately.","112168":"Like many Cafayate reds of stature, this opens with funky murkiness, leather, animal notes and baked characteristics. The blend is 70% Tannat with Malbec and Syrah, and overall it's full-bodied, snappy in the mouth, and good in terms of offering integrated plum, raspberry and spice flavors. Shows a lot of heat and burn on the finish, however. A wine with individuality. Drink now through 2012.","112189":"Aromas of tomato, spiced plum, cherry and asphalt are encouraging. This feels somewhat syrupy and clunky, while candied berry and spice flavors are strong. A modicum of varietal herbal spice rises up on an otherwise sweet-tasting finish.","112384":"Grapy and jammy smelling, this feels narrow and high in acid, bearing plum and tart cherry flavors that turn more sour with time. The finish is tomatoey and abrupt.","112385":"This is not a consistent wine year to year. Some vintages are true and vital, but this is clunky, with flavors of honeyed white fruits and bitter almond skins.","112392":"Light on the nose, it feels tangy in the mouth, with sharp flavors of mustard, brine and lime. This finishes with a pickled flavor.","112399":"A nutty apricot aroma marks the nose. It feels creamy and sticky, with sweet vanilla and baked fruit flavors. With time it turns more cloying.","112401":"This is saturated, flat and flabby on the nose, with pudgy blackberry aromas. It has a static, jammy mouthfeel, tasting overspiced and heavily oaked.","112572":"Leathery berry aromas are earthy and come with toasty oak. A round, flush, jammy palate brings plum, wild berry and resiny oak flavors in front of a forward, lively, oaky finish that's drying and resiny.","112617":"Fruity up front, with cherry cough drop, smoke, rubber and black plum aromas. Feels forward but resiny and creamy, with cocoa, vanilla, sawdust, plum and berry flavors. Juicy but drying and acidic late, with a lasting woody impression.","112632":"Floral lead scents come with lychee and citrus aromas. Feels crisp, citrusy and tangy, with full acidity and lemony flavors of orange and lychee. Long, solid, driving and fresh on the finish. Drink as soon as possible.","112641":"Tangerine and citrus aromas give the bouquet an orangey element, and there's a pinch of oak and tarragon in there as well. The palate has a mild, buttery texture and creamy flavors of peach and apple. Honeyed and creamy on the simple finish.","112642":"Fresh and straightforward on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas. The palate is pulpy but good, with flavors of fruit punch and melon. Turns a little sweet and pithy on the finish, but holds it together. Perfectly good for the price.","112643":"Tight berry aromas lead the way, followed by a lively but aggressive palate with jammy, sweet, candied berry flavors. Turns a little syrupy and sweet on the finish, but overall it succeeds in a generic sort of way.","112648":"An intimidating wine in that it's dark, huge and heavy. The nose is a roasted mass of tar, rubber, smoke and baked berry fruit. It's thick and fleshy in the mouth, with flavors of cola, chocolate, blackberry and blueberry. Minty and warm late, and overall it's more about color and size than refinement.","112657":"Fiery, spicy, herbal black fruit aromas set up a tight, herbal palate with oak in support. Flavors are sweet and also creamy due to ample oak, while the finish is light in fruit, with a tomato accent.","112711":"Spicy, hard aromas blend with pasty black fruit scents. The palate is big and lively, with baked flavors of blackberry and dark plum. Turns tight on the finish, which is crisp and tannic. Good Bonarda and a food-friendly wine.","112727":"Starts out with some heaviness and aromas of fresh cement and lacquer. With airing it improves, revealing a high-acid, fresh palate with raspberry, saline and herbal flavors. Roasted and firm on the finish, with a bit of excess heat.","112894":"Toasty, oaky and a bit lemony on the nose, this has baked apple notes that are friendly. It feels round and honeyed, with toasty, candied flavors that veer toward pear, apple and honey. Resin and cinnamon flavors work the soft, sweet-tasting finish.","112940":"This is oakier and more expensive than prior Trapiche Chardonnays, but it's not necessarily better. It smells like a rubber band and a barrel, bearing resiny flavors of mango and melon, with lots of sweet oak and vanilla tones.","112957":"Somewhat murky and smelling of compost and green berry fruit. Feels full and wide, with a hard palate containing milk chocolate and molasses flavors. Finishes bitter, dark and herbal, with gripping tannins. Tasted twice.","113204":"Now at the end of its peak, this is showing mature lychee, melon and soft-fruit aromas along with citrus, mango and nectarine flavors. It's tasty and pure, with only a slight bit of oily harshness that most Torront\u00e9s show. Drink immediately or wait for the 2010.","113210":"Like any good Bonarda, this is a tough wine. But on the other hand, it's flush, very dark and full of black-fruit flavors and texture. The nose is piercing but honest, while the palate is big and fleshy, with firm tannins, extract and bright black cherry and blackberry flavors. Thick throughout, with bacony notes to the finish.","113343":"Dusty, jumbled aromas of prune, raisin, sugar beet and leather are disparate. Chunky and flabby in feel, this tastes of oak, tomato and stewed berries. A flat finish fails to bring it around.","113345":"Fruit and freshness are in short supply in this salty Pinot Gris. An angular palate is both chunky and acidic. After salty baked-apple flavors, bitterness takes over.","113352":"Floral, oily aromas are not typical of Chardonnay. A plump, melony mouthfeel is chunky, while this wine tastes both tropical and bitter, with a bath-soap character.","113357":"Raisin and prune aromas are up front, and overall this Malbec is not showing any fresh fruit on the nose. A wide palate lacks cut and shape, while this tastes weedy, raisiny and green.","113362":"An oxidized nose and a deep burnished gold color are telling. Acidity barely keeps this Chard upright. A highly briny flavor profile is salty, lightly vegetal and oaky.","113364":"Marginally fresh on the nose, with aromas of black tea and compost, this is sugary and confected. Hickory and syrup-like flavors end with the tang of barbecue sauce.","113397":"A green and herbal style of northern Argentine Cabernet Sauvignon, this smells like tobacco, green bean, bell pepper and oregano. Quite tannic in feel, it bears a roasted herb flavor, finishing savory but green.","113405":"After light scents of butter and spiced apple surface, the wine turns briny and pickled, both in aromas and flavors. It feels fleshy on the finish, with briny stone-fruit and citrus flavors.","113424":"This opens with red fruit aromas that are wrapped around earth and leather scents, yielding a rustic whole. It feels snappy, with red fruit acidity leading to a gritty, lively palate, with flavors of brown sugar, red pepper, plum and raspberry. Long on the finish but short on texture.","113425":"Subtle and fairly deep, with aromas of berry, pastry and cherry cough drop. It feels lively and good, with blueberry and plum flavors in front of a textured, medium-deep finish.","113428":"Dense and sweet up front, the nose is balanced and deep, with blackberry and graham cracker aromas. The palate feels grippy and concentrated, bearing blackberry, dark plum and black pepper flavors, with a lifted flower note. This finishes mild and spicy.","113434":"The chiseled lemon-lime aromas are minerally and crisp, with a touch of lychee. This feels light on its feet but shows depth, with flavors of citrus, green herbs and lychee. It's smooth and fresh on the finish, with a green herb note.","113436":"This is jammy and bulky from the get-go, with heavy fruit aromas leading to a saturated, dense palate that feels thick. Baked, blackened flavors of sweet blackberry, chocolate and mocha mark the palate.","113476":"Dark, tarry aromas of baked black fruits lead to a lively, jumpy palate with resiny oak. Roasted berry and hickory-smoke flavors finish with a wave of forceful, dominating oak, leaving a barbecued taste.","113478":"Jumpy berry aromas are crisp and slightly charred. Rugged tannins and alert acidity create a high-energy palate. Dark flavors of black fruits and chocolate are slightly herbal, while flavors of herbs, clove and wood spice control an aggressive, fiery finish.","113627":"Jammy aromas of cassis and red-licorice candy lack framing. This wine feels dense and compact. Medicinal berry and plum flavors carry a bitter edge, while green tannins make for a raw finish.","113649":"Reduced, jammy berry aromas open this loud Malbec that ambles across the palate with no sense of restraint. All about gritty, screaming red-fruit flavors and baked notes, it lacks elegance.","113669":"Initial oak-based scents of plastic and rubber give way to minerality and stony aromas of cassis and plum. In the mouth, this youngster is wide, jammy, fleshy and chewy. Flavors of earthy, loamy black fruits and licorice pick up herb, spice and anise flavors on a forward-leaning finish. Drink from 2015\u20132020.","113680":"Nice and ripe, with cassis, blackberry and some oaky softness up front. The palate is convincing and properly textured, and it deals tasty cassis and plum-like flavors. Across the board this wine is comfortable and comforting; it finishes short but composed, with honest Malbec color, feel and flavor components.","113819":"Blackberry and charred aromas announce a juicy, tight-framed palate with crispness and modest depth of fruit and texture. Oaky flavors of vanilla and chocolate accent snappy notes of red currant and plum. Raw tannins, citric acidity and related bite make the finish a bit fierce. Drink through 2021.","114144":"Crisp cherry and plum aromas are gritty. This Malbec shows wiry acidity but the palate is still a touch soupy. Salty plum and oak spice flavors include notes of clove and pepper. As a whole, this is oaky and fairly heavy.","114152":"Leather, raisin, cherry and mild green aromas feed into a full, chewy palate that's kind of blocky. Medicinal, herbal plum and berry flavors are standard and finish with herbal, spicy notes.","114159":"Leathery animal notes blend with stalky berry and plum aromas in front of a bumpy palate with hard tannins. This tastes of herbal plum and berry, with a mildly green, oaky accent. That same oaky, green action repeats on the finish.","114228":"Inky, black aromas of asphalt, licorice and shoe polish hit hard, and the alcohol is immediately evident. This is gigantic in the mouth and carries some burn, but flavors of coffee, chocolate cake and wild berry are exotic and finish firm and generous, with multiple layers. Drink this ripe Malbec through 2018.","114249":"Concentrated berry and mossy aromas are inviting and introduce a fresh palate that rolls comfortably along. Black fruit, spice, herb and licorice flavors finish minty, spicy and long. This wine is from the Tupungato region, and it shows: It's balanced and herbal, but also loaded with fruit.","114301":"Similar in style to the higher-priced Cobos wine from the same vineyard. Bramare delivers cassis, plum and berry aromas rolled into a pleasant and familiar whole. Feels rich but refined, with meaty flavors that hit on leather, berry, black plum and chocolate. Spicy and chocolaty on the finish. Drink now through 2014.","114403":"Cab Franc is an emerging variety in Mendoza and this jammy fleshy version won't hurt the cause. Inky berry aromas are wide and fruity, not specific. A full-volume palate is a bit heavy, with blackberry, chocolate and peppery flavors. The finish hangs around with similar flavors, grapy weight and just enough acidity to maintain integrity.","114568":"Concentrated blackberry and prune aromas are wrapped in a blanket of chocolaty oak. Side-to-side jamminess and beefy tannins make for a full-force mouthfeel, while minty blackberry flavors end plush but with focus. Herbal notes of rosemary, thyme and mint add complexity. Drink through 2024.","114681":"Herbal blueberry aromas blend with green and blue-fruit tones on the nose. The palate is disjointed in minty flavors of oak and berry fruits that finish thick.","114705":"Raspberry and rubber-band aromas lead to a saturated palate with full tannnins and flavors of plum and plum skins. A mildly hot finish with grapeskin residue maintains the high volume this Malbec is putting out.","114860":"Bold and pruney, with herbal, soft, ultraripe aromas in front of a jumpy yet partially stewed palate. This blend of Malbec with Bonarda and Syrah is your typical huge, tannic bruiser with big extract, huge tannins and just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Pretty good and perfectly drinkable, but a little over the edge.","114909":"Jammy, ripe and loaded with inky, sweet black-fruit aromas, the bouquet on this modern Cab Franc draws you in. Once there, look for a big but balanced palate with blackberry, roasted notes, loam and chocolate flavors. The satisfying finish is pure and long, with toasty blackness.","114911":"With classy aromas of cedar, dark berry, aged balsamic vinegar and spice, this blend of Tempranillo, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is layered and holds onto its freshness and kick. Heady flavors of baked black fruits, coffee and spice finish long, with mocha notes and a creamy texture. Drink through 2017.","114954":"After picking yourself up off the floor having digested the price, the wine is excellent but not otherwordly. Sweet, dense and calm on the nose, with alluring black fruit and raisin aromas. Feels hefty and gritty, with rooty, sweet flavors of brown sugar and baked blackberry. Finishes round, big and smooth, with generally good balance. 120 cases made; drink now through 2014.","115116":"Dark in style, with graham cracker, shoe polish, hard spice and blackberry aromas. It feels staunch and edgy, then tastes deep, with a blackberry flavor backed by rubber and chocolate. The finish is marked with cocoa powder and vanilla notes.","115119":"This opens with a breeze of air freshener, tropical oils, green fruits and apricots. Fresh and crisp in feel, it has mild green-fruit flavors that are led by notes of lime and lychee. The finish is creamy, tropical and slightly bitter.","115129":"Untamed and herbal on the bouquet, this has a coconutty sweetness that's offset by scratchy berry and grassy notes. It feels firm, with high acidity and tight tannins; the herbal flavors mingle with notes of sweet cassis and baked berry.","115152":"Ripe, lush berry and vanilla aromas announce this nicely oaked blend of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. The drying tannins are firm, and vanilla, mocha and blackberry flavors finish with tannic grip but also a sense of purity and lushness. Drink through 2023.","115154":"Concentrated berry and plum aromas are potent. In the mouth, this blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cab Franc is massive but also abrasive and narrowing due to fierce tannins. Giant raspberry and blackberry flavors include chocolate and coffee notes. It settles on the finish but remains scratchy out the back door. Drink through 2025.","115223":"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec is overtly woody smelling in support of chunky earthy berry aromas. A full, racy, balanced palate deals structured tannins and salty plum flavors backed by a heavy dose of wood spice. On the finish, this is dry, oaky and tannic. It's good now, but will be best from 2020\u20132025.","115226":"Round aromas of chocolate-covered raisin set up a loaded palate. Salty berry, cassis, baking-spice and chocolate flavors finish with a full helping of berry and plum fruit, while this maintains a moderately full outlook on the finish. Drink through 2021.","115243":"This high-priced Cabernet Sauvignon, which is entering its prime, shows reedy berry aromas along with notes of prune, cola and spice. In the mouth, this is a bit on the soft side, while candied cola, cassis and cherry flavors finish with a note of chocolate. Overall, it's ripe, tasty and ready to drink.","115518":"A good value Cabernet from Argentina? You bet. This one smells like a bowl full of berries touched up with spice, vanilla and leather. It's fresh and ripe in the mouth, with flavors of blackberry jam and nutmeg. Smooth on the finish, it gets things right without pushing the envelope.","115592":"From vines planted in 1955, this is a rose-tinted Pinot with a woven, integrated bouquet of toast, mineral and berry fruits. There's more Burgundian character here than New World, so it pours on the cerebral scents and flavors of tea, rose hip, strawberry and raspberry. Reserved in style, but good to drink now and over the next few years. If $100 seems like a lot to spend on Argentinean Pinot, you should try to give this a taste at some point; you may be convinced otherwise.","115678":"Meaty, minty scents accent core cassis, jammy blackberry and oaky aromas. In the mouth, this benchmark Argentinean Malbec is tight and structured, with no flab or excess weight. An exotic mix of blueberry, cassis and Middle East spices finish long, with oak-driven lemony snap. Drink through 2020.","115679":"This concentrated, midnight-black Malbec delivers the aromatic goods in the form of charcoal, grilled meat and blackberry scents. An extracted palate benefits from core acidity, while black cherry, cassis and blackberry flavors come to rest on a rich but controlled finish. Drink through 2018.","115720":"Neutral on the nose except for some oily rusticity. The palate is full with okay acidity and sweet flavors suggestive of mango, pineapple and melon.","115751":"This is your quintessential New World Best Buy. The bouquet is full, slightly oaky and a touch burnt, and overall it's very nice. Same goes for the mouth, full of ripe berry and cassis flavors. It's medium to full in terms of weight and intensity, while the tannins create a chewy, masculine sensation.","116009":"Earth and rubber notes on the bouquet give way to black fruit and black olive aromas. It feels fresh, with a good acid level and a solid body supporting flavors of wild berry, plum and spice. The finish is toasty, with a fair amount of oak and bacon flavors.","116020":"This is an admirable aged Malbec, but it's definitely tannic and tough. The nose is hard and rubbery, with tire, mushroom, graphite and black cherry aromas. Feels tight as nails, with burnt caramel, tomato, green herb and cassis flavors. This finishes with some warmth.","116021":"This opens with a whiff of green and clam shell but quickly transitions to black plum and berry scents. Tannic and rugged on the palate, it has a mix of blackberry, chocolate and herbal flavors. The finish is firm, with length and more than enough power.","116128":"Controlled on the nose by blackberry, mint, menthol and fire. Like the 2008, this is not the easiest road to run, but it is a blast of penetrating blackberry, boysenberry, heat, spice and dark minty length. Tasty but tough, with the roughness and quality meeting in the middle. Drink in a couple of years.","116242":"Pretty aromatics include balsam wood, blackberry and blueberry. The palate is lush but well structured, with bullish berry, chocolate and creamy oak flavors. Minty and super spicy and long on the finish, with a lasting dark toastiness.","116433":"Dark spicy aromas of black plum and black currant are solid. In the mouth, this is saturated and hard, with heavy overall density and strong tannins. A dark, spicy, blackened set of dark-berry flavors finishes with more spice and mint than fruit.","116434":"Stalky aromas of leathery berry fruits suggest animal and earth. This is raw, tannic and hard on the palate, with saucy berry flavors that fall off towards stalky and stewy. A dense tannic finish is structured but tastes herbal and stalky.","116468":"Opens with light tropical aromas, toasty oak and vanilla. It's honest on the palate, where the body is good and structured and the flavors of peach and apple are accented by toasty oak. Nice and balanced, but maybe a touch woody for what it is.","116478":"Tight and intense for a $10 varietal, with crusty, charred oak aromas on top of ripe berry fruit. The palate is thick and full, with clamping tannins and flavors of lemony oak, plum and blackberry. Vanilla and mocha work the woody finish.","116668":"Clean, neutral aromas of white fruits, hay and vanilla wafer lead to a citrusy, round palate. This fresh Chardonnay offers orange and apple cider flavors in front of a clean finish.","116761":"Tropical fruit aromas come with notes of bath soap and white-flower blossom. This is easygoing and healthy on the palate, with just enough snappy acidity. Flavors of lime and green banana run long on the finish, which shows a touch of the variety's patented oily bitterness. Drink immediately.","116926":"Floral aromas of wisteria and lychee are tropical and musky. In the mouth, this unoaked Chardonnay feels oily but also citrusy. Flavors of lychee and lime finish similarly, conveying tropical overtones.","116927":"Harsh berry aromas carry a note of horseradish. The palate is blocky in feel. Short, somewhat bitter black-fruit flavors finish stewy and suggest overripe raw materials.","116948":"Berry aromas turn more jammy and unfocused with airing. An offputting, buttery, creamy palate tastes of stewy, earthy plum and compost, while the finish brings an artificial oak flavor. The blend is 60% Bonarda and 40% Malbec.","116971":"Concentrated blackberry and black currant aromas are ripe and come with a balsamic note. It feels juicy, full, lively and fresh, with oaky dark-plum flavors accented by rooty, herbal notes. Dry tannins mark the finish.","116975":"Cassis, sugar beet, leather and mild herbal aromas make this Cabernet appealing on the nose. It feels slightly syrupy and resiny, but with its core acidity the palate remains in good shape. Flavors of plum and cassis have a strong vanilla and oak resin accent, while the finish is tannic, roasted and robust.","117124":"Odd aromas of bath soap and cherry feed into a creamy, rubbery feeling palate.","117146":"Decayed fruit aromas are less than fresh. This is uncomfortable on the palate, with flavors of weedy berry and mint. Short and medicinal on the finish.","117153":"Aromas of geraniums, celery and grassy fruits lead the nose, while flavors of green, soupy red berries finish stemmy.","117211":"Deep, dense raisin, prune and blackberry aromas set up a chunky palate that follows the nose. Blackened, slightly bitter flavors of baked berry fruits and licorice finish with some chop and heat along with a continuation of the wine's licorice flavor.","117231":"A ripe, modern success with everything a fan of New World reds might want. The nose is floral and beautiful, with fine oak scents supporting brilliant raspberry, plum and spice aromas. It's deep, smooth and pressing in the mouth, with a delicious set of blackberry, coconut, vanilla and creamy flavors. A beauty to drink now through 2017.","117249":"Hard aromas of tire rubber and black fruits lead to a clampy palate with raw tannins. Blackberry and rubber flavors finish on the bitter side.","117252":"Leathery, feral aromas including stemmy notes define the nose on this just-good-enough Malbec. There's not much give to the acidic palate, while flavors of mint and red fruits finish scratchy.","117263":"Compost and strong herbal aromas lead to a rubbery palate with stewed tomato and leathery flavors. A salty, rubbery tasting finish fails to bring this around.","117271":"Char, clove and rubber aromas dominate what's otherwise leafy and herbal. A tight, hard-tannin palate features peppery, bitter flavors of black fruits in front of a pinched, narrow-feeling finish.","117306":"Stewy, murky aromas suggest muddy fruit and spent coffee. This feels clumsy and grabby, while the flavor profile is baked and herbal, with not much vitality. Prune notes and residual murk show on the finish.","117308":"Grassy, green aromas are dull and fruitless. The palate is citric at first but then it collapses. Flavors of citrus and tarragon finish bland and with vegetal leanings.","117315":"Foxy, candied red-fruit aromas settle on raspberry. The palate is pushy and fiery, with medicinal berry flavors that taste sweet. Bright acidity makes the finish choppy.","117318":"Chunky, oxidized aromas announce a wine that's past its prime. A globular, round mouthfeel lacks definition, while flavors of caramel and oxidized stone fruits finish woody, toasty and bitter.","117323":"Lean, dusty red-fruit aromas are redolent of nail polish. A grabby palate is chunky and home to syrupy, cloying flavors of medicinal red fruits. Burnt, rubbery notes characterize the finish.","117324":"Toasty, bready and oxidized, this lacks freshness. The palate is low on structure and carbonic foundation, while flavors of papaya and scrambled eggs are sulfuric. A yeasty, bready finish seems spent.","117327":"Dusty, yeasty aromas are faint. This feels flat on the palate, with a mix of weedy citrus flavors. Green, herbal notes carry the finish. Tasted twice.","117403":"Of all the large-format White Pearl varietals, this Torrontes tastes and feels the best. It has the grape's pungent aromas of acacia and talc, and the flavors are solid and persistent as the palate yields green melon and honey. Finishes tangy and fresh, meaning it hasn't yet started to fade.","117405":"Spice, rose hips and raspberry make for an open and welcoming nose. The palate delivers generic berry flavors, size, tannins and spice. It finishes a little harsh, with pepper and burnt notes. But mostly it's a solid everyday Malbec.","117407":"Big and fruity, and for the most part holds together and exhibits more good qualities than its faults. The flavor profile drives full-bodied black fruit and a finish that cuts out quietly. Not over the top in any way.","117414":"Meaty, herbal and foresty on the nose, all of which are typical aromas for this Salta-bred Malbec. Linear in the mouth and acidic as it tastes exotic due to herbal notes and eucalyptus. On the other hand it's full of blackberry and chocolaty richness. Crisp and nicely built on the finish.","117459":"Warm, loamy, oaky aromas of pastry and blackberry set up a tannic, jammy, cheek-pounding mouthfeel. This is 75% Malbec and the rest Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's dark and chocolaty, with blackberry, prune and coffee flavors. A heaping of chocolate and fig makes the finish quite friendly; drink through 2019.","117503":"The nose is grassy and minty up front. Syrupy in feel, the palate bears a heavy green note and a tinge of raisin.","117636":"Tropical, floral aromas are modest but enchanting. Plump and balanced on the palate, this blend tastes a bit yeasty and creamy, with green banana and herbal infusions. A floral finish shows a touch of bitterness.","117657":"Mint and graphite aromas make for a cool nose on this 50\/50 Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon. Rubbery tannins mixed with extracted berry flavors create more noise than poise on the palate. A spicy, herbal, chocolaty finish is punchy and borderline punishing.","117679":"Fully oaked, and you can tell via the aromas of coconut, resin, vanilla and latex that sit on top of tobacco and floral berry scents. Feels tight and high in acid, with herbal-leaning red berry flavors. Fresh and basic on the finish, with lasting acidity.","117741":"Brawny, toasty aromas prop up a sturdy oaky nose with a familiar dark-berry core. This Malbec is tightly wound, with wiry acidity. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, spiced plum, chocolate and cardamom finish earthy and mellow, with a lingering note of exotic spice. Drink through 2022.","117787":"Potent but integrated oak and blackberry aromas come with a note of licorice. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc is blocky and almost collapses under its own weight. Herbal, spicy flavors of fresh mushroom, roasted plum and tomato are typical of Salta. It finishes full, saturated and a bit chunky. Drink through 2020.","118037":"Salinic and almost dilute on the nose, which belies the richer banana and vanilla flavors that control the flavor profile. In the mouth, the wine has good bounce and acidity, so it feels alright even when things turn creamy on the finish.","118044":"Purple and extracted, with aromas of roasted meat and ripe black fruits. A vigorous blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that's full-bodied and offers commendable balance and flavors of baked berries, molasses and hoisin sauce. Thick and creamy on the finish.","118055":"This is rough and gritty smelling, with burnt, stalky berry aromas. It feels straightforward, with rubbery-tasting berry flavors that lead to a sweet, warm finish.","118058":"Hay and green apple aromas are about all that you can extract from the nose. It feels top heavy and awkward, with mealy citrus and maderized apple flavors. The finish is full, fruity and baked. Drink now.","118066":"This smells shrill, like rhubarb and cranberry, but it's also a tad weedy. It tastes of grapefruit rather than berry fruit.","118180":"Black-fruit aromas come with notes of rubber and smoke. Full and rugged feeling, the wine has juicy acidity and inherent raciness. Flavors of blackberry lean toward jammy, while subtle oak notes enhance this full-bodied, fruity red.","118214":"Heavy, rubbery aromas of iodine and damp cellar are earthy but not fully convincing. Like many Michel Rolland wines, this is huge, spongy and tannic, with maximum extraction. Massive, grapy flavors of black fruits and bacon finish herbal, minty and tannic to an extreme. Drink through 2019.","118224":"Ripe berry aromas are darkened by heavy notes of tarry asphalt and barrel char. This feels full and chewy, with peppery flavors of dusty spice, hickory smoke and black fruits. A short, bold finish is firm but low on fruit.","118252":"Concentrated, ripe blackberry and cassis aromas come with peppery spice and cedary oak notes. This is big and generous on the palate, with roasted, well-oaked blackberry flavors. A touch of heat lends sizzle to the finish. Drink through 2020.","118255":"Smoky aromas of fresh-cut wood blend with berry and cassis form a welcoming, generous bouquet. This feels lively on the palate, albeit tartaric. Oaky plum, cassis and vanilla flavors finish full and agreeable. Drink through 2019.","118285":"Gritty aromas of tire, road tar and black fruits are common to Bonarda wines. This has a crisp firm angular palate braced by taught acidity. Raw flavors of tomato, red plum and hard spices are savory and finish with gusto.","118315":"Aromas of berry fruits, barrel spice and desert herbs lead to a solid palate that's tight as a fist. This tastes dry, spicy and oaky, with peppery berry and plum notes. An oaky spicy finish offers just enough bold plum and berry fruit.","118317":"Dry, earthy berry aromas are lusty and integrated. This has a crisp snappy punchy mouthfeel that's driven by lively acidity. Savory, salty flavors of berry fruits, hard spices and tomato finish with scrubbing acidity and good length.","118377":"elon and peach aromas create a bouquet that's nondescript. This feels solid in the mouth, with acidic cut. Flavors of nectarine run sweet, while the finish takes on a cloying feel as it delivers thick melon and peach flavors. Drink now or wait for the 2013 vintage.","118378":"This is spicy, dry and woody on the nose, with blackberry aromas. The body is medium in size, with adequate balance and herbal flavors mixed with saline and berry fruits. A warm, oaky, saucy tasting finish shows a hint of green.","118730":"Bargain hunters need not apply, but if you're looking for a pricey but serious Argentine red, the '06 Magdalena Toso is a fine place to begin. At 70% Malbec and 30% Cab, it's stout, dark and rich. Aromas of coconut and mint announce new French oak, while the density and purity of the blackberry and plum fruit is commendable. Finishes long and ripe, with spice, prune and leather. Good acidity ensures that it will age well for three to five years.","118747":"Tropical fruit aromas are suggestive of bath soap and body oil. This feels obtuse, with depth and an oily sensation to the palate. Chunky, ripe, oily flavors of melon and orange finish loud and ripe, with a deeper set of tropical fruit flavors than your average Argentine Torront\u00e9s.","118885":"Almost everything about this wine is right on the money, from bouquet and flavors to feel and price. The nose is sweet and floral, with deep, alluring berry aromas. The palate offers a fine texture, with pure, layered blackberry, cola and spice flavors. Satisfying on the finish and complete.","118895":"Here's a Bordeaux-style blend to snap up if you're lucky enough to find it. It's a definite re-issue in that it was first released at $25 in 2006 but was put back on the market last year at $15. And what a bargain it is: Earth, tar and tobacco vie with dried cherry and raspberry on the nose and palate; the finish is long, elegant and dry. A mature, classy wine to drink now.","118959":"Bready apple aromas carry the nose. The palate is plump but low on bubbles and acidity. Drab flavors of woodspice and cinnamon rest heavily over a finish that tastes like spiced applesauce.","118961":"Soapy, floral aromas are more like those of a scented candle than most Malbecs. Next is an astringent, raw palate with sketchy plum flavors and bitterness to the finish. This doesn't taste convincingly natural.","118962":"Oily citrus, apple and mealy grapefruit are not particularly pleasant aromas. This is heavy and sticky, with overweight citrus and mango flavors. A melony, sulfuric finish brings the close.","119063":"An interesting but questionable value with Patagonian individuality. The nose features clove, wild flowers, leather and hot berry fruit aromas, while the feel is clacky and tannic, and the flavors a little baked and stewy. Raisin, heft and berry soup characteristics make this a ripe, full-bodied force to reckon with.","119067":"A heady wine with mocha, chocolate, balsamic notes and black fruit on the bouquet. At first it seems thick and dumbed down, but it opens up to display bold berry flavors, stewed fruit, chocolate and savory accents. It's just lively enough, but overall this ranks as a saturated, bulky, round wine that falls squarely into the category of New World and ripe.","119138":"Grassy aromas include notes of citrus, apple, wheat and pool water. This feels fruity and a touch pulpy. Tropical, briny white-fruit flavors are pithy and finish light in weight, citrusy in flavor and ultimately a touch bitter.","119231":"Quite floral and thus it smells different than the usual beefy, black-fruit-dominated Malbecs that Mendoza is known for. On the palate, it's zesty and yields cherry, raspberry and chocolate flavors. The mouthfeel is crisp and stylish, while the finish settles and doesn't seem too acidic or lean.","119300":"Citrus, lychee and mineral are the key aromas. It feels alive, with nice acidity and flavors of nectarine, peach and lychee. This is sweet, oily, pithy and true to the variety from start to finish.","119309":"Berry and black plum aromas build the nose. It's bold but a little acidic, with medium intensity and weight supporting snappy flavors of wild blackberry and slightly tart plum. The finish is quick and juicy.","119330":"Cherry and plum aromas are earthy, gritty and not overly potent. The palate is saturated, with the right amount of body weight and volume. There's a blitz of berry and black cherry flavors, backed by a finish that's black in nature and shows mild bitter notes of chocolate and coffee.","119467":"Wayward, funky aromas of wet dog and candied fruits don't provide much elegance to the bouquet. This also feels somewhat bland and dilute, which is unusual for Argentina. Herbal, minty flavors of cherry and plum finish peppery, green and raw in feel.","119469":"Earthy and stalky on the nose, this wine struggles to come up with the goods. It's sappy and citric in feel, with burnt, stalky flavors of herbal raspberry. A tart tasting, oaky finish does little to help this along.","119472":"Candied cherry and raspberry aromas are dilute by Mendoza standards. The palate is regular at best, with juicy generic flavors of plum and raspberry. This finishes raw in feel, with little depth of flavor.","119486":"Walnut oil and grit on the nose are not exactly welcoming aromas. This feels oily, while the palate delivers little more than a quick hit of tropical fruit flavors followed by a nutty, bitter finish.","119608":"This smells gritty, much like burnt leather. After that, stalky, herbal aromas rise up. In the mouth, it's grabby and tannic but not overly hard, with earthy, roasted flavors of leathery berry and salt. A savory tasting finish with modest fruit is lengthy and feels solid.","119794":"Lightly volatile, balsamic aromas blend with cedary notes and berry scents. This feels round and fresh, which is typical of the Uco Valley. Blueberry, spiced plum and cassis flavors finish with chocolaty oak and mocha flavors as well as juicy acidity.","119796":"Depth and complexity are key parts of this ripe Malbec that opens with hints of mushroom and stewed berry fruits along with cedary oak and tobacco. Mature and dense on the palate, this mixes blackberry fruit with raisin and prune, then follows with tea, spice and chocolate flavors on the back palate and finish. Drink now.","119810":"Earthy blackberry aromas are spicy and moderately complex. Structured and sound on the palate, with a strong tannic framework, this tastes of well-defined cherry and cassis. Spice and chocolaty notes on the finish are barrel driven.","119811":"Deep, lush black-fruit aromas are warm and horsey. Tight and well built, this ripe Malbec tastes of toasty blackberry blended with chocolate. A smooth, balanced finish with lift and nothing overly heavy or oaky is fitting.","119820":"Floral red-berry aromas come with a note of wet clay and also a dusting of dried herbs. Wide on the palate, this rubs up against your cheeks. Herbal plum, blueberry and peppery flavors finish with ripeness and freshness. Drink through 2019.","119929":"Everything about this Tempranillo-led blend rings true. It's full and flush on the nose, with clean berry and snappy tomato and spice notes. The mouthfeel is wiry and bold, with darts of acidity. Flavors span the red-berry spectrum, while the finish condenses in juicy, classy fashion. Drink through 2019.","119941":"Cool, earthy aromas of wild berry, herbs and graham cracker set up an angular feeling palate with plenty of acidic pop. The flavor profile features reedy raspberry and plum flavors accented by bacon flavors, while the finish is long, narrow, firm in feel and a touch hot. Drink through 2019.","119945":"Cola and berry aromas start out rocky but become earthier and richer with time. This is chubby and ripe, with a hardy level of extraction. Blackberry, mocha and coffee flavors finish with a note of chocolate, and with tons of fruit and proper balance, this is easy to like.","119985":"Black cherry, blackberry and marzipan aromas are full, lusty and inviting. This has a chewy, full-bodied and layered mouthfeel to go with the dark-fruit flavors that are aided by spice notes. A peppery chocolaty finish is solid, ripe and friendly. Drink through 2020.","119986":"Deep cool aromas of cola and toast blend with sweeter notes of maple and blackberry on this lush full-bodied Malbec. Flavors of blackberry, boysenberry, coffee, mocha and black pepper finish nicely on a well-cut, well-proportioned finish. Drink through 2020.","120008":"Earthy aromas of forest floor, mushroom and herbs share space with more typical blackberry, cassis and shoe polish scents. This is bold but mildly tartaric and scratchy in feel. Blackberry, coconut and vanilla flavors display the wine's core ripeness and oak content, while the finish is long and flavorful, with density and weight. Drink from winter 2016 through 2022.","120010":"This Malbec-led blend opens with grapy black-fruit aromas. The palate is saturated through and through, while intensely ripe flavors of blackberry, cassis and black plum finish long but not aggressive. This comes across as being well polished and smooth; drink through 2022.","120021":"This power-packed new Malbec from the son of legendary Mendoza winemaker Jorge Riccitelli shows lush blackberry and cassis aromas along with burnt toast and graphite notes. A huge, saturated palate is resiny and chewy, while flavors of baked black fruits are oaky and savory, with a saucy finish that's bulky. This is full, chunky and delicious; drink through 2024.","120024":"Heady aromas of cola and root beer come with notes of lemon peel, coffee and baking spices. This blend of 73% Malbec and 27% Cabernet Sauvignon is healthy as can be in terms of feel, with nothing ponderous or out of whack. Barrel char, coffee, graphite, licorice and cassis flavors finish smooth and silky, with a touch of heat. Drink through 2021.","120033":"Pure, concentrated blackberry and cassis aromas are right on target, as is most of this impressive Malbec that hails from 88-year-old vines. An exuberant palate shows young, bouncy, rubbery tannins, while this tastes complex, with blackberry and plum flavors playing off savory, saucy notes. An everlasting finish says drink all the way through 2027.","120054":"Rocking black-fruit aromas come with strong accents of wood grain, char and desert herbs. This is big and rich from front to tail, with poking but controlled tannins and ripe, heady flavors of blackberry, cassis, herbs and toasted wood. Plum, blackberry, salty notes and charred oak flavors define the finish; drink through 2022.","120056":"Initially this is a touch jumpy and nervy smelling, but with airing it shows elegant blueberry, cassis and mineral notes that aren't just big and brawny. A flush, bold mouthfeel delivers on the promise of the bouquet, while ripe plum, blackberry, pepper, herb and saline flavors finish savory and dark, with chocolaty notes and ripped muscularity. Drink this staunch Malbec from 2017 through 2023.","120137":"Talcum powder and apple aromas accompany a big whiff of resinous oak. On the palate, it's tropical in both feel and flavors, with plenty of weight and aggressive tastes of pineapple and mango. Feels a bit sticky and not quite precise, with a chunky finish.","120184":"A bit heavy and granular on the nose, with oily aromas that raise question marks. Fortunately, the wine mostly tastes true, with apple-based lead flavors followed by some pithy bitterness. The finish registers as dull, yet there's still some grab to the wine. Seems to be fading.","120250":"This ripe Malbec offers jammy blueberry aromas that hint at raisin but pull back in the nick of time. A round pulpy palate is home to black cherry, berry and plum flavors supported by loamy earthy notes. A fleshy finish isn't exact but it's friendly. Drink through 2019.","120284":"Smells a lot like compost and green herbs. The palate is bitter, hard and stalky, with grassy flavors and a weedy finish. Tastes burnt out, like old coffee grinds and marginal berry fruit.","120380":"Very red and slightly grassy on the nose, with aromas of strawberry, mint leaf and rhubarb. It's a juicy screamer in the mouth, with intensity, blazing acidity and wild raspberry and plum flavors. Dry, tight and long on the finish.","120422":"Cedar, graphite, marzipan, black plum and blackberry aromas ooze power and ripeness. This is concentrated and dark in style, with oaky blackberry and cassis flavors. Spice, vanilla, raisin, cassis and chocolate flavors reflect maximum ripeness, while the finish is dense, layered and potent. Drink this hefty, extracted Malbec through 2020.","120467":"Rustic smelling at first, this is showing a fair amount of animal and leather on the nose. In the mouth, this is wiry and pointed, with crisp acidity. Angular currant and red plum flavors finish clean and juicy.","120501":"Basic apple and vanilla bean aromas carry the nose to a plump, round palate with tropical flavors and banana. Feels peachy and tastes yeasty and sweet on the finish. Highly regular as a whole.","120502":"Seems like we're catching this wine late in its cycle. It's not very expressive on the nose, and even though there's still life to the palate, it's dealing only mild apple and citrus flavors followed by heat and acidic scour on the finish.","120504":"This is proof that vintage variation is alive and well in Argentina. Reflecting a hot year, this is stewy and heavy. It smells of licorice, mint and black fruit, while the palate is syrupy. Prune, raisin and stewed blackberry flavors are front and center.","120541":"This is one full-bodied, hefty wine. The nose is toasty, minty and a touch herbal. In the mouth, solid tannins support what would otherwise be a syrupy, soft Cabernet. Flavors of baked blackberry and cassis finish with brown-sugar sweetness and length. This is a wine for folks who like their Cabs rich and plush.","120924":"The nose is brushy and earthy at first, then herbal and rubbery. It feels like red berry jam on the palate, with raspberry flavors mixed with leafy, herbal notes. A sweet vanilla note appears on the finish.","120927":"Green aromas of oregano and basil blend with tomato and red plum. It feels grabby and thick, with heavy flavors of carob and herb-accented red berry.","120938":"Red fruit aromas come with green notes of tomato leaf, oregano and sage. It tastes tangy, with flavors of tobacco and red berry. The finish is stalky and herbal tasting.","120945":"This is rough and gritty smelling, with burnt, stalky berry aromas. It feels straightforward, with rubbery-tasting berry flavors that lead to a sweet, warm finish.","121113":"This is exceedingly ripe tasting, with a syrupy texture. Along the way, you'll encounter tar and rubber aromas in front of flavors such as carob, vanilla and stewed berry fruits. A minty, oaky finish is the final weighty act.","121123":"Crisp, lightly herbal raspberry aromas are a touch reedy and green. This feels chewy and saturated, while herbal, candied, slightly syrupy flavors of sweet berries finish minty and hot.","121218":"Woodspice and composed black-fruit aromas are key components on a smoky dark nose. This blend of Malbec, Cab Franc and Merlot feels jumpy and alive, but also in balance. Lightly roasted plum and berry flavors are peppery and not overly oaky, while this resides squarely on the balance line across a long stable finish. Drink through 2022.","121240":"Grapy, jammy boysenberry and blueberry aromas are exotic, with integrated barrel and spice notes. This feels weighty but balanced; flavors of blueberry, currant and chocolate finish with plum-like juiciness and length. Drink through 2021.","121245":"With an opaque purple color and boysenberry aromas that include notes of raisin and prune, this obtuse, chunky Malbec shows hard tannins and deep, dark flavors of black olive, fig, prune and roasted meat. A toasty, slightly hot finish with licorice notes is bullish. Drink this concentrated, ripe Malbec through 2020.","121255":"Achaval-Ferrer's wines are unique across the board. This one from La Consulta in the Uco Valley shows boysenberry aromas with an herbal cut and a note of leather. The palate is at once juicy and smooth\u2014flavors of desert brush, herbs, blueberry, savory plum and mixed spices finish with energy and subtlety. Drink through 2023.","121300":"Floral aromas of blueberries blend with funky notes of coffee grounds on this unusual rendering of Cabernet Sauvignon. A hard palate hammers down with tannins, tasting of burnt coffee, green herbs, spiced plum and black currant. A minty flavors rises up on a finish that pulls up short.","121304":"This blend of Cabernets Franc and Sauvignon includes Pinot Noir. The nose is floral and redolent of blueberry, red plum and licorice root. On the palate, it's an acid bomb, with sour flavors of plum and red currant. A pinching, drawing finish is lively and fresh.","121305":"Gamy aromas lead to a sinewy, lean palate. This funky Cabernet tastes of creamy oak, plum and green herbs. It finishes a bit weedy, with savory offsets.","121313":"After rubbery, dark-fruit aromas set things up, the palate feels racy and forward, with dark berry, spice and peppery flavors. It feels solid on the finish, while the fruit character holds on for a good while. Readily available, with 300,000 cases made.","121455":"Full but fresh blackberry and plum aromas show a note of tea before turning a touch grassy. Chewy and full on the palate, this is leafy and herbal tasting, with blackberry and pepper notes. A spicy, chocolaty, lightly leafy finish seems right for Cabernet Franc; drink through 2021.","121595":"Rubbery plum and berry aromas lean toward red fruits after airing and settling. Racy acidity makes for a firm palate, while this tastes savory and like meaty berry and plum. A tight finish holds onto a meaty essence.","121597":"Exotic aromas of cardamom and ginger accent blueberry scents prior to a crisp fresh racy palate that's downright tangy in character. Raw cranberry and pie-cherry flavors feature a note of cherry tomato, while this is fresh, peppery and spunky on a finish that frankly tastes a touch sour. Drink through 2018.","121608":"Aromas of herbs and desert brush blend with raisiny berry scents. This feels grabby and tannic, while jammy, herbal berry flavors flatten out with airing. A loamy tasting finish loses some intensity and spirit as this settles.","121609":"Aromas of violet petal and gamy berry fruits come with a strong oak-based whiff of sawdust. This feels blocky and generically big, while saucy berry flavors taste roasted, with a strong hint of clove. On the finish, this remains roasted and saucy tasting.","121806":"Jumbled and jumpy on the nose, which struggles to find itself. Time gives this wine a chance to strut, and while it doesn't ever find a great groove it does offer youthful plum and berry flavors followed by resiny tannins. A little too scattered and pocked to rate better.","121813":"A bit heavy and sweet, with big lemon-lime aromas followed by cloying pear and mango flavors. It's more creamy and sticky than desirable, but the core flavors are admirable and you can't take issue with its purity. Would be better if it were more agile.","121891":"This is minty green up front, with a dilute cherry aroma. It feels hollow with green flavors that override mild red-fruit notes. Herbal on the finish.","121941":"Harsh, grassy, weedy berry aromas mix with a heavy amount of clove. In the mouth, this is screechy and way off balance. A clove-heavy flavor profile is oaky and messy on Kaiken's entry-level Malbec.","121943":"Gamy, rubbery aromas mark this sizzler with major balance issues. Sour flavors of currant and lemon finish with nothing but acid.","121969":"This is Alamos's top Malbec, and it is fat and savory on the nose, with rubber, leather, asphalt and cured-meat aromas in addition to showing jammy fruit scents. In the mouth, this is lush and meaty, with blueberry, jerky and campfire flavors. A toasty, stout finish is big and weighty, but overall this fruit bomb is balanced.","121978":"Raisin, black plum and oregano are the aromas that define this lightly baked, earthy Malbec. In the mouth, this is direct and slightly raw in feel, but not overly so. Flavors of herbal fruits, raisin and stewed berries finish solid and with a peppery taste that introduces a mild burn to the picture. Drink through 2017.","122016":"Jammy blackberry aromas come with a hint of brine and a rubbery note of latex. This is big and tannic on the palate, but also a touch clumsy. Stewed black-fruit flavors run short, while minty oak, grapy berry and toasty spice flavors drive the finish. Drink through 2020.","122040":"Price aside, this is absolutely wonderful Malbec. The nose is pure and toasty, with minerally dark-berry aromas, cola and pastry notes. The palate is so rich and smooth it's like liquid heaven, while flavors of polished blackberry, espresso and mocha pudding finish mellow as can be, like a silk robe coated in Swiss chocolate. Drink through 2016; 170 cases made.","122189":"Butter, toffee, oak and sawdust aromas make up the bouquet. In the mouth, white-grape tannins are firm and grabby. Flavors of citrus, pineapple, melon, banana and oak are tropical and end soft, with buttery weight. Drink now.","122211":"Getting past the giant blast of oak that dominates the bouquet is not an easy task, but the intrepid wood chopper will find another side to this wine, one that's full of bright, juicy black fruit and syrupy core sweetness. Of course, the oak is always present and with that comes mocha, coffee and vanilla notes. Imported by Gascon USA.","122300":"Generic berry aromas come with herbal, earthy accents and a lactic note. The palate on this Malbec-led blend is grabby, while flavors of saline, roasted plum and berry finish with chocolaty weight.","122349":"Intense, fiery aromas of licorice, blackberry and marzipan are rooty and still a bit raw after years in bottle. This Malbec blend is lush and ripe, but blocky tannins show some bite. Flavors of black fruits and toasty oak finish even more blackened and toasty. Drink through 2021.","122374":"Fleshy and smelling of berry skins, this is a large Malbec. Everything tastes dark and fruity, with heavy flavors of spice and toast that powerfully linger on the finish. Texturally, this is tannic, ripe and syrupy.","122382":"Rubbery aromas of asphalt vie with berry fruits and hints of green herbs, particularly mint. The palate is big, soupy and round in feel, with herbal flavors of baked plum and raspberry. On the finish, things turn salty and herbal, with roasted overtones.","122387":"This SB delivers citrus peel, grass and other common varietal aromas. The feel is a touch flabby and soft despite modest acidity, while flavors of citrus fruits and green herbs finish round and long.","122405":"Earthy, murky, raw aromas of generic berry fruits topped with vanilla and marshmallow set up a chunky but lazy palate with herbal plum flavors that border on green.","122408":"Cool, dark-plum aromas are mildly herbal. This feels drawn-in and tough. Disposable berry flavors come with peppery notes, while the finish doesn't offer much new.","122409":"This pruny smelling Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot blend hits with a thud. Stewy and overripe, this tastes raisiny and like little else. Similar on the finish.","122421":"Aromas of prune and cocoa powder accurately portend a chunky, plodding palate with flat tannins. This is at maximum ripeness, but it's not totally balanced, as raisin, mint and black pepper flavors finish with heat and herbal notes.","122429":"Nobody ever said Argentina was Pinot Grigio country. This wine is yellow in color, with aromas of haystack and wheat. There's acidity to keep it upright, but flavors of briny citrus do little to bring it around.","122431":"This Chard is gold in color, with mushy, oxidized aromas of honeyed peach and apple. The palate feels flabby while flavors of vanilla follow on the finish.","122456":"Compact and concentrated up front, the nose is propped up with hints of spice and berry. This shows good body and balance, with berry and licorice flavors that are lightly baked, mildly herbal and peppery. Despite a touch of green on the finish, this is very good.","122460":"Red berry and cola aromas come with a cool menthol note. It feels chunky and jammy; the moderate-to-soft acidity creates a rubbery palate, with cherry and plum flavors. The finish turns sweet like caramel and slightly stewed.","122474":"Deep and dense, this smells horsey and leathery, with aromas of earthy berries. The palate feels racy with acidity, and the flavors of berry, cassis, cola and vanilla lead to a sweet, jammy finish, with touches of vanilla and caramel.","122475":"An oaky specimen that starts with maple syrup aromas, but it soon finds darker aromas of coffee, lemony oak and leather. This feels feels grippy and firm, with solid tannins and spicy, lightly herbal flavors of cassis and black plum. Dry and spicy on the finish, with a coffee-like bitterness.","122569":"Cloudy to the eye, with strained aromas of sauerkraut and barnyard animal. Feels heavy and tastes rustic, with burnt, stalky, anonymous flavors. Shows bitterness and stalky flavors on the finish.","122570":"Oxidized aromas are not inviting. After the doughy, yeasty opening, the palate deals oxidized flavors of bitter and sweet red plum. Bitter on the finish; barely worth a look.","122770":"Rubbery plum and berry aromas offer notes of leather and metallic minerals. This has an oaky feel, meaning it's sticky and lactic. Herbal, slightly green flavors of plum and berry are sweetened and softened by oak in front of a minty, lightly herbaceous finish.","122777":"Pine needle, orange peel and vanilla aromas are scattershot but pure. The palate is lean, tight and juicy due to pronounced citric acidity, while flavors of orange, tangerine and mango finish fresh but with a smear of resiny oak.","122784":"Woodsy, lightly floral raspberry aromas are mild. This wine revolves around a light-framed, dilute body, while flavors of cranberry, raspberry and dusty earth finish woody but shallow, with a preserving shot of acidity.","122826":"Alto is 75% Malbec and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose is cool and full of cassis, blackberry, cola and cedar aromas. This is ripe as they come without losing freshness; flavors of loamy berry and cassis finish with density along with prune and spicy, peppery flavors. Drink through 2020.","122836":"Chunky black-fruit aromas are ripe but familiar, meaning the nose is pumped full of richness and oak. Racy acidity on the palate gives this modern Cab spine, while in the mouthfeel stays on the fast track due to zesty acidity. Flavors of cassis and blackberry register as fresh and ripe, and the finish is crisp and not the least bit flabby. Drink through 2016.","122926":"This blend smells outright herbaceous and weedy. An astringent volatile palate is grating, while this tastes much like it smells: weedy and green.","122940":"Unconvincing aromas are hard to describe. This Malbec sparkler is coarse and foamy on the palate, with burnt peppery slightly bitter flavors of orange and grapefruit.","123084":"Brilliantly colored, with dynamite concentration and lovely black fruit and earthy aromas. Precise on the palate but also big and muscular, with silky tannins, grip and a late rush of deftly applied French oak. Delicious and a fine reflection of the Uco Valley, Argentina's top Malbec region.","123097":"The nose offers a fine mix of floral berry, dusty earth and classic Malbec richness, while the palate is juicy, balanced and tastes of cassis, blackberry, fresh plum, cracked pepper and baking spices. Full and long on the finish, and overall it's right where you want it to be. Drink now through 2011.","123108":"Dark and dense in color, this San Juan Malbec smells of jammy plum, prickly berry fruits and spice. A raw rugged palate is home to flavors of spiced black plum, tomato and herbs. On the finish, this tastes lightly herbal, with grip and drying tannins.","123135":"Melon, peach and dusty aromas give the wine a solid but flat bouquet. With soft edges and modest citric acid, it's a little dull and disjointed as it stresses melon and apple flavors. As Argentine SBs go, this is expensive for what it offers.","123141":"Browning in color, with mounds of dry spice, tea and earth aromas, but also a cooked, overoaked quality that doesn't serve the wine well. The palate is plodding and doesn't really evolve, while flavors of brown sugar, obvious oak and roasted berry seem to be fading. Expensive for what's in the bottle.","123144":"The Cabernets here, if you hadn't already guessed, are Sauvignon and Franc. There's a distinct herbal element to the nose, creating a \u201cgreen\u201d aromatic sensation. Meanwhile, the palate is coarse and on the acidic side, with red-fruit flavors accented by tarragon and oregano. Spicy but hot on the finish.","123298":"Pleasant apple and woodspice aromas are basic and limited but good. This feels balanced, with friendly melon, banana and tropical-fruit flavors. Light oak and related vanilla flavors drive the finish on this easygoing Chardonnay.","123312":"Wiry plum and raspberry aromas are jumpy and a touch candied. This feels bulky and grapy, with an obtuse body. Salty lightly herbal plum and berry flavors end with a touch of heat along with herbal leftovers.","123314":"Raspberry and cherry aromas are mild while not stirring much excitement. This feels a bit raw and tannic, but it's got enough body to hold up. Berry and plum flavors finish with hints of spice and chocolate.","123353":"Flowery lime, kiwi and mountain stream aromas reflect the wine's clean personality. The mouthfeel is fresh and lightly wavy, with lychee, kiwi, lime and green apple flavors. Clear throughout, with good balance and weight to the finish. Very nice for a tangy, zesty, lean sort of white.","123354":"A heavy, roasted, charred nose gives this a dark outlook, and the bulky but smooth palate of black fruits and baked flavors does little to lessen the load. Feels good on the finish, although it tastes rather normal and a touch bitter. Round and fairly rich Malbec.","123360":"The question is how much oak can you handle? If you like a heavily toasted, resiny type of full-bodied Chardonnay, add two or three points. If you absolutely hate that style, then subtract a few points. For those of us in between, look for resiny, toasty, heavy aromas on top of a thick, chewy palate full of baked apple and tons of wood spice. One-dimensional but well made.","123455":"Rubbery on the nose, with licorice, horse hide and black fruit aromas. Almost too lush and soft in the mouth, with a candied nature and ultrasweet, syrupy flavors of vanilla and baked berries. Finishes with brown sugar and chocolate cake flavors. Extremely sweet; spineless.","123462":"Hot, rubbery and burning on the nose, and then clampy in the mouth, with compact, highly generic flavors of red cherry and plum. The heat and burn that's present up front re-emerges on the finish, where jackhammer tannins hold court.","123468":"Sweaty and feral smelling, with just a tad of the pleasant lychee and melon this grape is known for. Feels heavy and oily, with barely any acidity and pithy, oily, citrus flavors. Clunky stuff for new Torront\u00e9s.","123525":"Dark, smoky, herbal aromas come with cheesy notes of oak and horse hide. This has a wiry, high-acid mouthfeel and herbal, spicy, pinched dark-berry flavors. High acidity creates a racy sensation on an oaky, fast-paced finish.","123614":"Heavy oak and caramel aromas are dominant, with suggestions of mocha and sawdust. This is tight and drawing on the palate, with wood-dominated flavors of resin, clove and distant berry fruits. This simmers with oak and clove on the finish, but should clean up with another year or so in bottle. Drink through 2017.","123754":"The nose of this Malbec is fresh and shows black-fruit and plum aromas. Medium bodied, with plum, red berry and herbal flavors. Tasty on the finish, this delivers all the basics for $10.","123755":"With ripe yet oaky aromas, this is a basic Malbec to enjoy with simple foods. The palate is juicy but comes with a buttery, creamy feel. As for flavors, look for buttery oak riding on top of modest, quick-hitting berry. On the finish, it's oaky more than fruity.","123781":"This pitch-dark, fully extracted Malbec from La Consulta in Mendoza's Uco Valley delivers blackberry, black pepper and brushy herbal aromas on what amounts to a massive, spot-on bouquet. Big, chewy and tannic on the palate, with earthy, roasted flavors of blackberry, prune, savory spices and raw oak, this finishes meaty, slightly salty and strong, with wild herb and black-fruit flavors. Drink through 2022.","123791":"Blackberry, plum and violet aromas make up the core of this young, elegant Malbec's bouquet. At this early stage, the wine is rubbery and tannic, but full of kick. Blackberry, hickory notes and chocolate make for a full, woody flavor profile, while pepper and bitter chocolate flavors close this out with punch. Best from 2017 through 2030.","123867":"This is one dense, saturated blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot. The nose is all black fruits and prune, while the palate runs deep and dense, but without a lot of finesse. Jammy black-fruit and blueberry flavors are peppery, while the finish is hulking. It shows the heat of its alcohol.","123876":"Earth, tomato and baked black-fruit aromas define the nose on this fully ripe wine. In the mouth, it's rich and immense, with soft tannins, mild acidity and a lot of weight. Flavors of roasted berry fruits are spicy and savory, while the finish is jammy in feel, with a salty flavor.","123936":"Rubbery stewy berry aromas give way to a pinched-feeling palate. This tastes of salty roasted plum and it stays that way on a dense, chewy, meaty finish.","123937":"Rough conflicted aromas of horseradish, beets and horse hide lead to a hard grabby palate that feels sticky and tannic. The heavy oak blends with stewed herbal black-fruit flavors before a scratchy tannic finish.","124077":"Inky oaky aromas of graphite and black fruits introduce a palate that's supremely saturated. Flavors of roasted plum and blackberry are savory and meaty, while this feels lush on the finish but also strapping and sinewy. Dos Mundos purports to represent both Portugal and Argentina, but this is all Argentina in character. Drink through 2023.","124084":"Concentrated full-force aromas of mixed black fruits come with notes of cheesy oak and animal hide. This is not your usual 15% abv bruiser even though it's full-bodied and burly. The key is racy acidity and a 14.2% alcohol level, which allows toasty, chocolaty berry flavors to show a mild herbal element as well as choppy freshness on the finish. Drink through 2022.","124087":"Rich, rooty berry, cola, coffee and toasty black-fruit aromas get this Malbec blend off to a nice start. Flush and fruity on the palate, this offers black cherry, cassis, toast, black pepper and herbal flavors. A forward, hard-driving finish is lightly medicinal in flavor. Drink through 2022.","124093":"The clean look, nice bead and good mouthfeel are the saving graces here, because it smells strange, almost like steamed ballpark hot dogs, and it tastes odd and innocuous, like papaya juice. The look and feel are good but the smell and tastes are not so great.","124108":"Blowsy and tropical, with aromatic flabbiness. The feel is acceptable and the flavors of papaya and dry white fruits bring some saucy, resiny qualities. Finishes with sappy, resiny oak notes and just enough Chardonnay character to not be disastrous.","124113":"A bit sweaty smelling, with pinched grapefruit aromas and distant citrus. The flavors say generic apple and lime, and there's a flatness to it. It's a little sugary as well. OK for a wine with pronounced low acidity.","124135":"A new wine from Norton named after the winery's Austrian owner, Gernot Langes, is a serious Bordeaux-style blend with creamy oak, vanilla, chocolate and espresso on the bouquet. It's deep, dark and full of cassis and berry flavors. All totaled, this is a prized offering that's textured and ripe. It has the right feel and the right stuff in general.","124136":"A little scattered and jumbled at first, but once things settle this Bordeaux blend is impressive. Scents of clove, blackberry and grape candy are sincere, while the palate houses blueberry, cassis and other black-fruit flavors. The feel is tannic and a bit choppy, but the ribald finish of bacon, leather, vanilla and resin is convincing. Drink now through 2011.","124176":"Cool aromas of cola, blackberry and earth come with cedary oak. In the mouth, this blend of three vineyards is abruptly tannic, actually choppy and hard. Plum and raspberry taste dry and toasty before a grating finish. Drink through 2023.","124191":"Cherry and cassis aromas are dark and clean, with more than adequate ripeness. This Cab feels a bit edgy and abrasive, but not scratchy. Oaky, resiny flavors of berry fruits and plum finish spicy, with crisp acidity and tannins that poke and prod. Drink through 2021.","124192":"Crisp, minerally cherry aromas come with a complex note of desert herbs. This feels totally fresh and full, basically just right. Nicely oaked, ripe flavors of plum and berry fruits are chocolaty, dry and spicy on the finish.","124195":"Moderately ripe berry and cassis aromas show an increasing level of wood grain as this breathes. A jammy palate is plump and medium deep, while flavors of earthy berry fruits and stewed plum taste smooth at the start but herbal and mossy on the finish.","124196":"Crafted in a New World way, this displays toasty, creamy oak and baked apple aromas. The palate is healthy and bold, while flavors of popcorn, white bread, butter, honeydew and banana maintain freshness and clarity across the finish.","124372":"Grapy aromas of black plum and blackberry are balsamic and a bit herbal. This blend of mostly Malbec and Syrah is medium in body and somewhat juicy. Blackberry, plum and peppery flavors finish chocolaty and lightly herbal.","124464":"Earthy and showing clay, milk chocolate, baked cherry and mocha aromas and flavors, and while the wine feels fairly smooth it doesn't do much but lay there on the palate. Kind of heavy, amorphous and seemingly fading, and overall it's a junior version of Salentein's dying Primum Pinot from 2004.","124467":"The nose is full of dust, cotton candy, peach pit and banana, while the palate is sugary and tastes like honeydew melon and pear. Fleshy and bland on the finish.","124473":"This yellowish SB from Argentina's northern Salta region is a strange bird that has never caught our fancy. This vintage shows melon, peach, lychee and wax aromas, while the palate is both sweet and tart, with a fresh-for-now feel that doesn't inspire confidence that it will last for long. Flat on the finish, and unsusual overall.","124475":"Deep purple in color, and soupy on the nose, with a strong hint of lemon. The palate is almost astringent due to elevated acidity, thus the balance of this Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon-Bonarda blend is sketchy. Tastes more like grape juice than fine wine, with a hollow, tangy finish.","124486":"Crafted in a New World way, this displays toasty, creamy oak and baked apple aromas. The palate is healthy and bold, while flavors of popcorn, white bread, butter, honeydew and banana maintain freshness and clarity across the finish.","124582":"Generic to the max, with simple white fruit and lettuce aromas. The feel is wet and juicy but nothing more, with simple green fruit flavors of melon, apple and kiwi. Bland but decent if well chilled.","124979":"Ripe, full, sweet, oaky and even a touch confectionary, with a whiff of cotton candy blending with resin and spice from the barrels. The palate is superconcentrated, with blackberry and chocolate flavors, and on the finish the oak pushes things toward toast, coconut and burnt logs. Woody, but powerful and appealing.","124988":"Rubber and savory berry aromas lead it off. The palate shows good texture and overall smoothness, with round cassis and plum flavors. Very competent and solid on the finish, with toasty, warming afternotes and only a slight tannic grab. Textbook Malbec given the price range.","125016":"Primary aromas of black cherry and cassis come with minerally notes, herbal hints and a drop of iodine. This feels good but narrow, while saucy, lightly herbal berry flavors end with tolerable saltiness. Drink through 2019.","125268":"A very oaky style of Malbec. The bouquet is full of cough drop, milk chocolate and mint, while the palate feels solid and beefy, but resiny. Flavors of berry fruits are softened and sweetened by oak and chocolate, while the finish is woody and tannic.","125275":"Opens with hard-baked berry aromas that turn briary and herbal with airing. Smooth tannins and meaty blackberry flavors are matched by barrel-driven vanilla and spice. Oaky and minty on the finish, with spunk and length.","125279":"Pretty aromas of cassis, cherry and sweet cream are inviting. Feels good, with zesty acidity and nice overall balance. Flavors of black currant, Bing cherry and plum cover the bases, while the finish is easygoing. The epitome of everyday Cabernet.","125320":"This lush, modern Malbec explodes with power then simmers with complexities. Opaque in color, the bouquet issues intense blackberry, lemon peel, graphite and toast aromas. In the mouth, it's full but not flabby, and then comes an avalanche of black-fruit flavors matched by notes of spice cake, molasses, pepper and mocha. It's warm, toasty and full of licorice on the finish. A superb wine to drink now through 2018.","125374":"This blend of coastal and desert grapes smells and tastes tropical, with floral notes and a preponderance of citrus character. There isn't too much variation to the flavor profile, which is centered on white citrus fruits.","125448":"Opens with warm, woody aromas that fold in molasses and maple along with mildly baked berry fruit. The palate is alert but balanced, with proper acidity pumping up cherry, plum and snappy berry flavors. Buttery notes and toffee warm the finish, which keeps its poise.","125452":"One of Altocedro's better efforts starts with meaty, ripe, chunky black fruit aromas and a wave of mocha, cocoa and berry syrup. It's a creamy specimen but has enough acidity and vitality to not run flat. Mocha, carob and plum extend through the finish. Drink now.","125453":"Interesting Malbec with character and individuality. The nose is savory and smoky, with spice and floral aromas. Full and ripe in the mouth, where roasted black fruit, clove, spice and cola all make a showing. Textured and sizable late, with a coffee note to the finish. Drink now through 2011.","125504":"Sweet, jammy aromas of blueberry and cassis suggest ripeness to the max. For confirmation, the palate is rich, plump, soft and a bit heavy, with prune, baked berry and cassis flavors that end in a chewy, warm, fully ripe finish. Drink this beefy, ripe Malbec now through 2015.","125561":"Cool aromas of kola nut and woodsy black fruit suggest ripeness. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot is linear and jammy in feel, without much depth. Spicy blackberry and grapy flavors are up a notch from simple, while this finishes with toasty oak and spice notes.","125580":"Ripe loamy black-fruit aromas are attractive on their own and benefit from an elegant note of balsam wood. Energetic and balanced in feel, this Malbec tastes of savory meaty black fruits. A toasty lightly oaked finish offers a shot of chocolate and a milder hit of coconut. Drink through 2020.","125581":"Tarry blackberry aromas are piercing and a bit gritty. This feels ripe, plush and balanced, with blackberry, spice and herbal flavors. A moderate note of heat rises to the surface of a finish with herbal blackberry flavors.","125654":"Bold, jumpy, reduced aromas of plum and berry fruits show little to no oak. This is chewy and jammy in feel, with standard berry flavors and almost no complexity as it heads toward a finish with mild animal and herbal notes.","125710":"Light, fresh aromas of lychee and melon are typical of the variety. A bright palate is comfortable in feel and offers pithy flavors of orange and nectarine. This turns more pithy and slightly bitter on the finish.","125823":"Opens with scratchy, dusty aromas of red fruits and herbs. The palate is round but clunky, with sweet, grapy flavors of blackberry and blueberry. Finishes rather oaky and mild, with a grainy feel.","125921":"This is textbook juice for the cellar. A cool, herbal nose turns cedary and stout. It's wall-to-wall tannins now, with complex flavors of red fruits mingling with tomato leaf, oregano, spice and tobacco (reflections of the 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that goes with more familiar Malbec). A bullish finish with mild green notes should soften with aging. Drink from 2014 to 2021.","125936":"Deep berry aromas combine seamlessly with sweet notes of marzipan and complex accents of balsam wood on what is an inviting, rich nose. This is rewardingly bright and structured on the palate, where blackberry, boysenberry and plum flavors carry onto a full, long finish. This is high-end, ripe Malbec. Drink through 2018.","125950":"Cola, cool earth and aromas of blackberry and cassis represent the nose of this always steady blend of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Solid and mouthfilling across the palate, this tastes heavily oaked and charred, thus there's a strong smoky complement to blackberry flavors. A peppery, toasty tasting finish feels a bit hot.","126033":"Toasty blackberry and prune are the key aromas on this plush Cabernet. A generous mouthfeel includes choppy tannins that will mellow in due time. Dark flavors of cassis and blackberry include spice and chocolate notes, while this finishes with ripe flavors of blackberry touched up by chocolaty oak. Drink this calm, slightly flabby Cab through 2021.","126043":"Dense aromas of fig, prune, cassis and blackberry are more mellow than monstrous. In the mouth, this Cabernet feels chunky, ripe and fully tannic. Savory berry fruit flavors and notes of cured meats and jerky finish a bit flat, with a lasting flavor of oaky chocolate. Drink through 2022.","126185":"Despite having several years in bottle, this Malbec opens with a huge blast of charred oak, shoe polish, lemon peel and rooty berry aromas. The palate is clipped and linear in feel, while flavors of coconut, vanilla and generic berry finish with lasting coconut and unsettled oak.","126246":"A wine that makes you take notice. The bouquet is intense, with minerality, char, huge black-fruit aromas and handsome shadings of chocolate and coffee. Power and purity come on like gangbusters, and the flavors are a classic mix of blackberry, cassis and fine Swiss chocolate. Heady, smooth and impressive. My highest rated wine yet from Carlos Pulenta's Vistalba label. Drink now through 2014. Composed of 87% Malbec with Bonarda and Cabernet Sauvignon.","126361":"A power-packed blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot that offers mossy aromas, earth and lush black fruit scents. The palate is lively yet balanced, with saturated wild berry, toast, anise and pepper flavors. Dark, toasted and showing licorice on the finish. A little hot and aggressive, so drink in late 2010 through 2012.","126388":"Big, dark, sweet and jammy on the nose, with earthy, candied, sweet aromas of ripe blackberry and herbs. The palate delivers bouncy, showy acidity, while the flavors of black cherry, dark plum and chocolate are solid and rewarding. A little pruney on deeper inspection, with a leathery quality to the wine's depth. Drink now through 2013.","126458":"Intense black-fruit aromas mix seamlessly with notes of graphite, cedar and dried Gouda cheese. This Bordeaux blend is firm and bolstered by grabby tannins and fresh acidity. Ripe flavors of blackberry, cassis, mocha and vanilla end with a lemony oak note, additional mocha and a hint of wood spice. Drink through 2022.","126474":"Pure blackberry aromas are dosed with spice, lemon peel and grit. This blend of Malbec and Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc is saturated and concentrated but still well balanced. Creamy, rich blackberry and chocolate flavors finish smooth, lusty and dark. This may not be overly complex but it tastes great and feels right; drink through 2022.","126475":"Perfectly sound and ripe blackberry aromas come with a rooty note, a touch of oaky coconut and fine-grained wood scents. This blend of 72% Malbec and 28% Cabernet Sauvignon is compact and layered. Ripe cassis, blackberry and chocolate flavors finish toasty and with hints of coffee and spice. Drink through 2022.","126476":"This fully ripe vineyard-designated Malbec deals aromas of blackberry, cassis, raisin and cedar cigar box. Seriously built and almost monolithic in size and stature, this offers a wave of upfront oak that frames blackberry, loamy earth and baking spice flavors. A woody, persistent, elegant finish is a fine way for this to fade out. Drink through 2023.","126530":"Robust, deep and candied on the nose, with rooty richness, medicinal notes and complexity. The palate is smooth, meaty, healthy and suave, with lush black fruit, prune and earthy flavors. Long, likable and showing a lot of depth and structure. Drink now through 2014.","126543":"Ripe black-fruit aromas are backed by hints of road tar and toasty oak. A round, firm palate feels right, while familiar high-end Malbec flavors of blackberry, baking spices and chocolate end with controlled tannins, spice notes and a full-bodied feel that's not too fleshy or soft. Drink through 2021.","126562":"This charred specimen smells resiny and of blackened oak, with grapy berry scents thrown in. In the mouth, this is rock solid and balanced. Heavily oaked resiny flavors rest on top of core blackberry fruit, while this shows woody dry tannins and salty baked berry flavors on the finish.","126631":"Smooth on the nose, this smells fruity, honest and whole. Dark flavors of blue fruits and peppery spices are a little shallow, while the finish shows mild Cafayate tannins and not much bite.","126636":"Scratchy cherry and berry aromas feature a note of warm earth. This blend of 45% each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot along with 10% Malbec feels tight, choppy and tartaric. Flavors of wild berry, cherry and cassis end long due to forceful acidity.","126669":"Reduced aromas of rubber and iodine are potent. In the mouth, this feels narrow and citric, with pronounced acidity. Flavors of black fruits are salty and pinched, while the finish lacks clarity and body.","126677":"Gritty aromas of severely baked berry fruits are tough to plow through. In the mouth, this Malbec is jammy, chunky and a touch flat. Flavors of stewed berries and prune finish thick and taste cooked. Ready to drink now.","126707":"Clean and well made, but underwhelming. There's basic blueberry and blackberry flavors riding on a medium-bodied palate, but overall the wine is more generic than specific. It's easygoing and causes no red flags to go up, however at the end of the day it doesn't show much personality.","126851":"Baked plum and berry aromas are lusty and jammy. In the mouth, this is tannic and the acidity is citric in character. Flavorwise, A Lisa is pumping out brawny berry flavors matched by lemony oak notes, and the finish is expansive, with blanketing tannic grip. This will show best in late 2014, after it's had more time to settle.","126852":"Hickory and other wood-based aromas and flavors dominate this Amarone-style blend. Amid all the smokiness there's cola and vanilla aromas and thick, heavy, meaty flavors of baked black fruits offset by toast, spice and chocolate. A sweet-tasting, jammy feeling finish closes the show.","126896":"A fruity, jammy style of Cab with thick berry aromas resting in front of a full-bodied, chewy palate with forward red berry and chocolate flavors. This is smooth, not complex and easygoing proof that Argentina is not only about Malbec.","126901":"Shiny pink in color, with youthful, crisp aromas of cherry and watermelon. Zesty and fresh on the tongue, with spunky cherry and raspberry flavors that finish with natural sweetness. Candied to an extent, but mostly it's fresh and balanced.","126902":"Orange blossom, nectarine and almond skin aromas are true to the grape and inviting. The palate maintains a light, juicy, citric feel as it delivers flavors of melon, apple and banana. Fresh and forward, with a hint of heat and bitterness to the finish.","127054":"Earthy, murky aromas of cherry and plum lack freshness and brightness. This wine is jammy and a bit clumsy on the palate, with saucy, savory berry and plum flavors. An herbal, jammy-tasting finish leaves you wanting more.","127055":"Medicinal cherry and plum aromas set up a palate with clipped, hard tannins. Forced flavors of oak and carob are more obvious than the wine's plum and cassis notes. Oak dominates the creamy, charred finish.","127065":"Earthy berry aromas come with woodspice notes. This is raw and acidic on the palate, and overall it feels prickly and a bit disjointed. Saucy plum flavors are salty, while the punch of red-fruit acidity propels a tangy finish.","127070":"Flowery, tropical aromas are pure Torront\u00e9s, although this one turns to applesauce the longer it breathes. A healthy-feeling but generic palate deals flavors of Thompson seedless white grapes and honeydew. It has a fresh but faint finish.","127074":"Mild white-fruit aromas are nonspecific but clean. This blend of Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay has a simple, citrusy palate feel and briny nectarine flavors. A briny flavor quality remains on the finish.","127094":"The color is deep purple, the nose dense, alluring and hinting at mint, shoe polish, violet and blackberry. Flavors are pure, modestly oaky and deep in terms of wild berry, coffee and chocolate.","127123":"Applesauce and fruit salad are rather strange, unconvincing aromas for Merlot, and the palate of plum and wild berry is big, broad and lunky. Jammy on the back end, with herbal berry flavors on the finish. Acceptable red wine but nothing special.","127292":"Smoky blackberry aromas introduce a blocky, ripe, chewy palate with full-force weight, extraction and tannins. Bold flavors of baking spices, clove, blackberry and plum end with chocolaty notes. This is a ripe, globular wine with definition and clarity to go with powerful, ripe flavors. Drink through 2024.","127303":"Intense, focused and also quite floral on the nose, this blend of Malbec, Cab Sauvignon and the Italian variety Ancellotta is all about the fruit. Flavors of fig, blackberry and cassis ride nicely on a smooth, chewy palate. On the finish, this is layered, deep in feel and toasty in flavor. Drink this impressive, full-bodied blend now through 2018.","127384":"Oily and tropical on the nose, with pungency and clarity. The palate is full, layered, plump and loaded with lychee, honeydew and green herb flavors. Provides good feel and just enough acidity to make for a long ending.","127612":"Given this Chandon-owned winery's success with Malbec, you might hope for more here. But this fading Chardonnay doesn't have much going for it. It's flat, with pleasant clove-like aromas and cider-like flavors. It also finishes flat, indicating a short lifespan ahead of it.","127618":"Licorice, raisin and ripe, loamy black-fruit aromas open this blend that's heavy on Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. Slightly jammy and flat in feel, this tastes ripe and soft, with lightly herbal blue-fruit flavors. A smooth, jammy finish indicates that this is ready to drink.","127619":"Floral, grapy aromas are exotic and herbal. High acidity creates energy but also a shearing sense. Currant, red plum and spice flavors end with a blast of blazing acidity and notes of baking spices, cocoa and herbs.","127737":"Lychee and a note of fresh green veggies define the nose on this well-made Torront\u00e9s from Salta. A lemony palate is snappy but also oily, which is common for this grape type. Salty nectarine and lychee flavors hold steady on a developed finish.","127750":"Oaky aromas of mocha and spice blend with racier scents of tomato and red plum. This Malbec feels full in body but sinewy and tough. Flavors of spiced tomato, herbs and salty berry fruits are savory. It finishes with toasty, peppery flavors and choppy tannins.","127815":"This Cab is earthy and mossy smelling, with tomato, herb, coconut and raspberry aromas. It's tannic on the palate, with oaky tasting cassis, herb and tobacco flavors. With a lot of body and power, this is a very good wine that suffers only from narrow, hard tannins.","127938":"Quite creamy and sweet on the nose, with marshmallow and candy aromas that are not that convincing. Solid in the mouth, with herbal fruit, chocolate and plump tannins, body and extract. Better in terms of mouthfeel and concentration than flavor. Malbec, with Cabernet, Syrah and Petit Verdot.","127964":"Pungent, yeasty, almost sweaty notes of onion and garlic blend with oak-infused cider and citrus aromas. This is round, fresh and not too heavy on the palate, while its oaky, smoky barrel and baked-apple flavors end with overt woodiness and mounting bitterness.","127975":"Murky, earthy aromas of plum and red berry feed into a creamy, saturated palate that's adequately balanced but not perfect. Syrupy blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors end with spice and herbal notes. This is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% each Merlot and Syrah.","127991":"This racy Cab smells a touch scalped, with modest, slightly candied cherry and raspberry aromas. On the palate, this is balanced but basic. Flavors of plum, black currant and a dash of salt finish firm and warming.","128152":"This is a true Luj\u00e1n Malbec, with earthy berry aromas and a loamy topping to the nose. A ripe, chewy mouthfeel is braced by modest acidity, while vanilla, maple, mocha and blackberry flavors are oaky and modern in style. On the finish, the feel is creamy yet fresh, and the flavors echo the palate.","128255":"Disappointing considering the source. The nose reeks of chocolate mint, marshmallow and burnt leaves, while the palate is tannic, sour and shows only citrusy red fruit notes. One of Lurton's weakest wines to date.","128263":"Smells like crushed vitamins, iron and minerals, but no fruit. Weak, funky and sour tasting, and then angular on the finish. There's even some sauerkraut in the mix. Not what we're looking for.","128328":"Weinert holds its wines back longer than almost any other Argentine winery, hence when you get a blend like this it's mature and ready. This is maderized, with aromas of earth, citrus, tobacco and mushroom. The palate is tight and houses tobacco, mocha, citrus and dried raspberry flavors. If you like aged Rioja, this is for you. The blend is Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot.","128393":"Rubbery, baked aromas of raspberry come with a minerally note of children's vitamins. This has a creamy mouthfeel but little stuffing or backing. Flavors of vanilla smother herbal red-berry notes, while the finish is lactic and tastes of residual oak.","128398":"Blanketed with heavy, minty, candied oak, this Malbec-led blend is meaty, sulfuric, pasty and gaseous on the nose. Plump, oaky and sticky on the palate, with vanilla and candied blueberry and black-plum flavors, this is more fat and oaky than structured and defined.","128531":"Argentine Nebbiolo is a rarity, and for one to be this good is a blessing. Leather, dark berry, earth and citrus aromas are mellow and subdued, but the palate is full and forward, with baked berry, molasses and espresso flavors. This is tannic and chocolaty on the finish, with lasting sweetness.","128579":"Cola and minty, herbal aromas come with raw oak and gritty, baked berry scents. This is rugged, tannic and grabby on the palate, with heavy wood resin flavors heaped atop blackberry and plum. Woodspice and heat drive the finish.","128803":"Foxy red-berry aromas suggest animal hide and wet fur. This feels raw, wiry and scratchy due to sharp acidity and rough tannins. Foxy herbal plum and currant flavors finish with an abrasive scour, mild heat and salty notes.","128921":"The nose on this Malbec-Merlot blend starts off charred and leathery, but with airing you'll get roasted berry fruit scents and mild stalky characteristics. Flavors of roasted berries, rubber and leather finish loud, with muscular tannins and blazing acidity.","128937":"The bouquet deals black-fruit aromas, earth notes and molasses. In the mouth, this maintains a fruit-forward outlook via jammy weight and ripe flavors of blueberry, blackberry and cassis. Mocha and coffee flavors along with textural density are what drive the finish.","128938":"Roasted black-fruit aromas are leathery and spicy but not baked or overly stewy. This feels rugged, meaty and tannic, with muscular plum, blackberry and smoky, spicy flavors that finish toasty, with tannic clamp. Drink through 2016.","129219":"Rubbery and leathery smelling at first, with berry and cassis aromas resting below the surface. Feels tannic and closed on the palate, with syrupy, reduced plum, berry and currant flavors. Not too much shows up on the finish other than thickness and a subtle plum nuance.","129223":"On first blush it comes across entirely green and herbal. Even with airing it continues to show salad dressing, tomato and herbal aromas in addition to red fruit notes. Full and solid on the palate, with bell pepper, tobacco and roasted berry flavors. Finishes with more herbal\/green hints and good structure.","129224":"Round, floral and sweet smelling, with citrusy acidity that pushes up passion fruit, orange and lemon flavors. There's weight and body come finishing time, and the overall impression is that of a tropical, dense white wine with some creaminess. Priced high for what you get.","129342":"Opens with hard, rubbery, leathery aromas. In the mouth, it's thick and chewy with black fruit but also an herbal edge. There's depth and plenty of oak here, and it finishes sweet and relatively smooth. Starts rough, improves in the middle, and then finishes fairly well.","129350":"Baked and broad on the nose, with toasty aromas, marshmallow sweetness and floral hints. The palate is tight, healthy and tastes of savory, meaty fruit including black cherry and wild raspberry. Leather and herbal notes work the finish, and overall this is nice but more basic than complex.","129356":"Quite good and above the masses when compared to the bulk of ros\u00e9 wines coming from Argentina. Made from Malbec, it's bright and floral, with a touch of citrus to the nose. Healthy, vibrant, balanced and cleansing, with flavors of berries, nectarine and pink grapefruit. Drink now.","129388":"Soft, ripe and chocolaty, with a raisiny quality on the bouquet. There's fading black plum and wild berry flavors; the mouthfeel is big but short on structure. Finishes with medium length and mild bitterness.","129606":"Typically fragrant, with floral aromas vying with mildly green notes of lime and lychee. Feels tangy and downright citric, with lemon, orange, lime and green apple flavors. Cleansing and acidic on the finish, with lemony snap.","129613":"Foxy and jumpy on the nose, with candied red-berry and cherry aromas. Feels resiny, but there's enough acid to keep it moving forward. Flavors of plum and berry come with a lot of oak and barrel influence. Finishes resiny, with hints of vanilla and a burnt quality.","129619":"Rubbery on first take, with sweet chocolate and carob aromas. Feels pretty thick, with a creamy lead into an herbal-tasting palate that's crowded with oak and milk chocolate flavors. Turns resiny on the finish.","129620":"Full of red-fruit aromas, particularly plum and cherry. Feels raw, with wild berry, ample oak and a lot of acid-based tang to the palate. Lightly toasty, with a mild cherry flavor to the finish.","129623":"Smells clean and mild, with peach and apple aromas. Rather foamy and rough feeling, with tangy flavors of stone fruits, green apple and pineapple. Light, juicy and fruity on the finish, but basic. Made from 100% Chardonnay using the Charmat method.","129632":"This single-vineyard wine is always dense and powerful. This edition opens with prune, blackberry, Graham cracker and earthy aromas. In the mouth, it's pinched, with rubbery tannins. Salty, roasted flavors are true to the Salta region, while the finish is black in flavor and bulky in feel.","129646":"This bold, earthy Malbec delivers aromas of cured meat and stewed notes, with some medicinal and floral smells. It's concentrated and chewy but not syrupy, with roasted plum and berry flavors running side by side with savory spice, pepper and brown sugar. A toasty finish has mild heat to it.","129673":"This is a top-dog Malbec from start to finish. Aromas of cassis, black plum and blackberry are well oaked and in harmony with each other. While this is tannic, rubbery and hard in feel, the wine's lusty plum, raisin, chocolate and herbal flavors can handle it. A spicy, toasty, chocolaty finish is fully oaked and strapping. Drink through 2023.","129677":"This Malbec is exceedingly ripe from start to finish. Aromas of blackberry, raisin, char and loamy earth announce a 16% heavyweight that holds onto its elegance. Flush, plump and elastic on the palate, this tastes of fig, blackberry, cassis and mocha. Chocolate and woodspice flavors drive a lush, dense finish that's a touch hot. Drink through 2020.","129705":"With its light color, minerally nectarine aromas and Provence leanings, this is a good facsimile of Old World ros\u00e9 with peach and raspberry flavors, a smooth finish and integrated acidic cut.","129709":"Compost aromas blend with thicker, richer raisiny notes. This feels deep and almost heavy on the palate, where the acidity is modest and stewed, with hints of herbal flavor. Black currant and blackberry come across fully ripe. Notes of coffee, herbs and salt dictate the finishing flavors on this huge Malbec.","129752":"Earthy, oaky aromas of roasted berry, tree bark, root extract and lemongrass are jumbled but not unpleasant. This feels blocky and heavy upfront, then more hollow as it breathes. Flavors of prune and black fruits are stewy, while chocolate, coffee and herbal notes steer a heavy finish.","129777":"Potent and herbal, this has aromas of tomato, olive, mineral and tobacco. It feels tight, drying and lively, with herb-infused flavors of plum and berry along with spicy oak. Rich in feel, but it's distinctly foresty and herbal tasting on the finish. This is 100% Malbec with an undeniable Salta imprint.","129886":"Full aromas of toasty oak, blackberry and vanilla feed into a saturated hard-pointed tartaric palate. Flavors of Christmas spice, oak and baked black fruits display hints of nutmeg and cola on a blocky hard finish. Drink through 2020.","129887":"Earthy balsamic aromas of cheesy oak, blackberry and cassis feed into a saturated tannic palate that's a touch scratchy and abrasive. Stewy blackberry and cassis flavors come with a dollop of vanilla and cheese, while this ends with muscular, grabby tannins. Drink this rich, heavy Malbec through 2022.","129890":"This inky Malbec opens with an oaky blend of vanilla, blackberry, prune, cassis and tobacco aromas. A compact, firm palate is just lush enough, while oak-based flavors of cinnamon and baking spices rest on top of spiced plum and cassis. A peppery finish is intermixed with tobacco notes. Drink through 2021.","129918":"This dark, meaty Malbec has some Agrelo fruit in it but it's mostly from La Consulta and Vista Flores in the Uco Valley. Aged in new oak for 18 months, it smells rich, smooth and inviting, with asphalt, mineral, violet and coffee aromas. The palate has bold acidity and healthy flavors that settle on blackberry and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2011.","129922":"There is a select group of under-$20 Malbecs from Argentina that really do the country and the variety proud. Santos is one of them; the 2006 is easy and ripe on the nose, with lovely cola, berry and herb aromas. The palate has a natural feel and bright black-fruit flavors. Not overly complex but a winner for the next year or two.","129926":"A lively, well-made blend of Tempranillo, Malbec and Syrah; B Crux is a bouncy, fresh youngster but still a serious wine with rock-solid black fruit, deep chocolate and spicy length. It's not super oaky as only half the wine sees new barrels, but you can definitely taste some wood. Will drink best in 2009\u20132010.","129934":"Andeluna's top wines tend to be ripe and plump, and so they come across as easy to drink and less demanding. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc is devoid of astringency and hard tannins. It's ripe, just a little rugged, and integrated such that the berry flavors are forward and don't need to fight to be appreciated.","129940":"Compared to the regular 2006 Malbec from Chakana, this wine steps up in weight class and wins the crown. It's a serious but inviting red with spongey, ripe berry aromas topped by pure raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. It's both racy and composed, with a pile of bitter chocolate on the long finish. Good through 2009 at least.","129949":"Raspberry and cassis aromas are fresh and upright while showing wiry, grassy accents. Full bodied, this features a jammy, pulpy palate that's fresh but low on definition. Herbal, lightly green infiltrations drift onto a solid, tannic finish. Drink through 2018."},"designation":{"16":"Felix","17":"Winemaker Selection","229":"Lunta","251":"Reserve","258":"Reserve","271":"Corte Malbec-Bonarda-Petit Verdot","278":"B Crux","280":"Reserva de
