    - Python Flask-powered API
    - at least 1 DB
    - custom D3.js
    - dashboard with multiple charts
    - at least 1 new JS library
    - must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records

- Perform a deep dive of existing data using machine learning
- Create a visualization that continues to learn where clusters lie based on ML.  
    (use D3 or Plotly to change the visualization)
- Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression
